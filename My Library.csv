Studies with RVC encapsulated in liposomes and complexed in cyclodextrins have shown good results, but in order to use RVC for lengthy procedures and during the postoperative period, a still more prolonged anesthetic effect is required. OBJECTIVE: This study therefore aimed to provide extended RVC release and increased upload using modified liposomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three types of vesicles were studied: (i) large multilamellar vesicle (LMV), (ii) large multivesicular vesicle (LMVV) and (iii) large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), prepared with egg phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/α-tocopherol (4:3:0.07 mol%) at pH 7.4. Ionic gradient liposomes (inside: pH 5.5, pH 5.5 + (NH4)2SO4 and pH 7.4 + (NH4)2SO4) were prepared and showed improved RVC loading, compared to conventional liposomes (inside: pH 7.4). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An high-performance liquid chromatography analytical method was validated for RVC quantification. The liposomes were characterized in terms of their size, zeta potential, polydispersion, morphology, RVC encapsulation efficiency (EE(%)) and in vitro RVC release. LMVV liposomes provided better performance than LMV or LUV. The best formulations were prepared using pH 5.5 (LMVV 5.5in) or pH 7.4 with 250 mM (NH4)2SO4 in the inner aqueous core (LMVV 7.4in + ammonium sulfate), enabling encapsulation of as much as 2% RVC, with high uptake (EE(%) ∼70%) and sustained release (∼25 h). CONCLUSION: The encapsulation of RVC in ionic gradient liposomes significantly extended the duration of release of the anesthetic, showing that this strategy could be a viable means of promoting longer-term anesthesia during surgical procedures and during the postoperative period.","2016","2017-04-04 14:29:05","2017-06-21 01:23:27","","1-10","","1","26","","J Liposome Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25811810","","; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/9SGBKK64/08982104.2015.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811810","","alpha-Tocopherol; Amides; Cholesterol; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug delivery; Drug Delivery Systems; Eggs; encapsulation efficiency; Ions; Liposomes; Phosphatidylcholines; sustained release","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current review summarizes these advances as they relate to defining the molecular and structural basis for disorders involving altered membrane structural organization (hereditary spherocytosis [HS] and hereditary elliptocytosis [HE]) and altered membrane transport function (hereditary overhydrated stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis). Mutations in genes encoding membrane proteins that account for these distinct red cell phenotypes have been identified. These molecular insights have led to improved understanding of the structural basis for altered membrane function in these disorders. Weakening of vertical linkage between the lipid bilayer and spectrin-based membrane skeleton leads to membrane loss in HS. In contrast, weakening of lateral linkages among different skeletal proteins leads to membrane fragmentation and decreased surface area in HE. The degrees of membrane loss and resultant increases in cell sphericity determine the severity of anemia in these two disorders. Splenectomy leads to amelioration of anemia by increasing the circulatory red cell life span of spherocytic red cells that are normally sequestered by the spleen. Disordered membrane cation permeability and resultant increase or decrease in red cell volume account for altered cellular deformability of hereditary overhydrated stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis, respectively.

Mice with severe HS and severe hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) also suffer from thrombosis, with incidences ranging from 15 and 22% in beta-spectrin- and ankyrin-deficient mice, respectively, to 85 to 100% in alpha-spectrin-deficient and band 3 knockout mice. A contributing factor to thrombosis could be loss of phospholipid asymmetry of the mutant red blood cells (RBCs), with concomitant exposure of the aminophospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS). Increased PS exposure occurs in RBCs from sickle cell and thalassemia patients and in RBCs from band 3-deficient mice. To determine if increased PS exposure correlates with thrombotic risk in HS and HE mice with ankyrin, beta-spectrin, and alpha-spectrin deficiencies, measurements of FITC-labeled annexin V binding to externalized PS on RBCs were performed. PS exposure is elevated in all mice with HS and HE, but the percentage of RBCs with exposed PS does not correlate with thrombotic risk in these mice.","2000-02","2017-06-21 00:30:26","2017-06-21 00:30:26","","75-83","","1","26","","Blood Cells Mol.

H.","The role of membrane lipids in the survival of red cells in hereditary spherocytosis","The Journal of Clinical Investigation","","0021-9738","10.1172/JCI106031","","Red cells in hereditary spherocytosis (HS) have a decreased ratio of membrane surface area to cell volume and therefore a spheroidal shape. This abnormality in shape predisposes them to pooling and destruction in the spleen. Although splenectomy prevents hemolysis in HS, the red cell defect, as manifested by spheroidicity, increased autohemolysis, excesive permeability to sodium, and hypermetabolism, persists. The role of membrane lipids in these manifestations in vitro and in cell survival in vivo was examined. Before splencetomy, and in spite of the presence of a young cell population, the cholesterol and phospholipid content of HS red cells is decreased. After splenectomy lipid values are similar to those obtained in normal subjects with spleens. However, after splenectomy for conditions other than HS the lipid content of red cells is greater than normal. Thus, when compared with the red cells of patients without HS who have also undergone splenectomy, HS cells after splenectomy are deficient in both cholesterol and phospholipid. Obstructive jaundice causes an increase in membrane lipid, primarily cholesterol, and a decrease in the osmotic fragility of normal red cells. When HS red cells are transfused into patients with obstructive jaundice they also become less osmotically fragile. Moreover, when incubated in obstructive jaundice serum, they gain cholesterol. This acquistion of membrane lipid in vitro does not result in a change in their rate of glucose utilization or sodium efflux. However, the transformation to a less spheroidal shape in vivo permits them to traverse better the splenic circulation and survive longer.","1969-04","2017-06-21 00:22:43","2017-06-21 00:22:43","","736-744","","4","48","","J.

Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) are good models for the study of lipid rafts. Here we report that DRMs can be obtained by treating human erythrocytes with the nonionic detergents Triton X-100 or octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C(12)E(8)) at 37 degrees C, and by treatment at 4 degrees C of cholesterol-depleted erythrocytes. Electron paramagnetic resonance with spin labels inserted at different membrane depths (5- and 16-doxyl stearic acids, 5-SASL and 16-SASL) were used to measure the order parameter (S) of the cell membranes and DRMs. We previously reported significantly higher S values in DRMs with respect to intact erythrocyte membranes. Here we show that higher S values were still measurable in DRMs prepared from intact erythrocytes at 37 degrees C, or from cholesterol-depleted cells at 4 degrees C, for both detergents. For 5-SASL only, increased S values were measured in 4 degrees C DRMs obtained from cholesterol-depleted versus intact erythrocytes. Flotillin-2, a protein marker of lipid rafts, was found in DRMs from intact cells in trace amounts but it was sensitively increased in C(12)E(8) DRMs prepared at 4 degrees C from cholesterol-depleted erythrocytes, while the membrane-skeletal proteins spectrin and actin were excluded from both Triton X-100 and C(12)E(8) DRMs. However, contrary to the 4 degrees C treatment results, flotillin-2 and stomatin were not resistant to Triton X-100 and C(12)E(8) treatment at physiological temperature. The role of cholesterol in DRMs formation is discussed and the results presented provide further support for the use of C(12)E(8) to the study of DRMs.","2010-04","2017-04-04 14:32:21","2017-06-20 22:58:14","","195-205","","3","234","","J.

The nonspecific membrane perturbation of narcotic chemicals can be quantified by the degree of disturbance of buildup and relaxation of the membrane potential in membrane preparations of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The effect concentrations obtained for this narcotic effect correlated well with the results from various toxicity tests on whole organisms. In addition, the effect concentrations at the target site, the biological membrane, were derived from the nominal effect concentrations using membrane-water partition coefficients. The test set of linear AEO comprised compounds with an alkyl chain length of 8 to 16 carbon units and 5 to 14 ethoxylate (EO) units covering more than four orders of magnitude of hydrophobicity (expressed as octanol–water partition coefficient). All AEO exhibited their toxic effect at concentrations well below the critical micelle concentration. When comparing aqueous effect concentrations, toxicity increased strongly with increasing length of the alkyl chain and showed a small parabolic dependence on the number of EO units with a maximum at eight EO units. With the toxic effect expressed in terms of membrane concentrations, all AEO exhibited similar activity in the concentration range typical for narcotic chemicals. The toxic membrane concentrations of AEO with 5 and ≥8 EO units were 200 and 60 mmol/kg lipid, which correspond to the critical body residues of nonpolar and polar narcotics in fish, respectively. In addition, the toxic effects of mixtures of AEO were measured and could be modeled as the sum of activities of the single constituents, confirming the concept of concentration additivity of compounds with the same mode of toxic action.","1999-12-01","2018-01-16 11:03:33","2018-01-16 11:03:33","","2767-2774","","12","18","","Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/E3456NMI/abstract.html","","","Critical membrane residues; Lethal body burden; Linear alcohol ethoxylates; Membrane toxicity; Quantitatives ructure–activity relationship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inappropriate use of detergents may affect the native fold of the membrane proteins, their binding to antibodies, or their interaction with partner proteins. Here we used cadherin-11 (Cad11) as an example to examine the impact of detergents on membrane protein complex isolation. We found that mAb 1A5 could immunoprecipitate Cad11 when membranes were solubilized by dodecyl maltoside (DDM) but not by octylglucoside, suggesting that octylglucoside interferes with Cad11–mAb 1A5 interaction. Furthermore, we compared the effects of Brij-35, Triton X-100, cholate, CHAPSO, Zwittergent 3-12, Deoxy BIG CHAP, and digitonin on Cad11 solubilization and immunoprecipitation. We found that all detergents except Brij-35 could solubilize Cad11 from the membrane. Upon immunoprecipitation, we found that β-catenin, a known cadherin-interacting protein, was present in Cad11 immune complex among the detergents tested except Brij-35. However, the association of p120 catenin with Cad11 varied depending on the detergents used. Using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) to determine the relative levels of proteins in Cad11 immune complexes, we found that DDM and Triton X-100 were more efficient than cholate in solubilization and immunoprecipitation of Cad11 and resulted in the identification of both canonical and new candidate Cad11-interacting proteins.","2018-01-05","2018-01-09 14:09:39","2018-01-09 14:09:39","","348-358","","1","17","","J.

A new surface functionalization route is presented to build surfactant coatings with monolayer thickness grafting molecules considered as nonreactive. A monolayer of -SO2Cl functions (from a p-benzenesulfonyl chloride) was first electrografted. It showed a high reactivity toward weak nucleophiles commonly found on surfactant end-moieties such as hydroxyl groups (-OH), and it was used to covalently graft the following: (1) nonionic diblock oligomers (Brij or CiEj, CxH2x + (OCH2CH2)nOH with x = 16 and n = 23 for Brij58, x = 16 and n = 10 for Brij C10, and x = 16 and n = 2 for Brij52); (2) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) short chains (PEO9 for (OCH2CH2)nOH with n = 9) and mixed formula. The surface modification due to these molecular coatings was investigated in terms of wetting properties and interfacial electrochemistry characteristics (charge transfer resistivity, capacity, and ions dynamics). Built on flat and transparent thin chromium films, Brij and PEO mixed coatings have been proven to be promising coatings for electrochemical biosensor application such as for stabilizing a partially tethered supported biomimetic membrane.","2017-12-06","2018-01-08 17:15:00","2018-01-08 17:15:00","","42313-42326","","48","9","","ACS Appl.

Effects of Short Chain Lengths","Langmuir","","0743-7463","10.1021/la991278b","http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la991278b","In this study phase transitions and thermodynamic properties of monolayers of short poly(ethylene glycol) chains (abbreviated as EG) covalently attached to lipids were determined by analyzing pressure−area isotherms at three different temperatures by using a film balance. The EG chain lengths were varied systematically between N = 3 and N = 15 repeating EG units. For the two longest EG chains (N = 12 and N = 15) a new synthesis is described. For short chains (N < 9) the monolayer phase transition is determined by the alkyl chain moiety of the headgroup, while for N ≥ 9 the typical behavior of lipopolymers is observed. For the fluid−gel phase transition the entropy and the corresponding latent heat were determined for 3, 6, and 9 EG lipids. In the second part the lipids were transferred to hydrophilic silicon oxide substrates by the Langmuir−Blodgett technique and characterized by their equilibrium swelling behavior under controlled humidity by using ellipsometry. In agreement with the monolayer experiments, we find a “polymer brush”-like behavior already at chain lengths of N ≥ 12 despite the fact that the “statistical” limit N ≫ 1 is hardly fulfilled. For degrees of polymerization of N = 3 and N = 6 EG units, relative small swelling ratios ρ are observed due to a “rigid rod”-like behavior. Between N = 6 and N = 9 repeating units an intermediate swelling behavior is found.","2000-04-01","2017-11-09 19:44:43","2017-11-09 19:44:43","","3835-3845","","8","16","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/9AC5X4D6/la991278b.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Equivocally, detergent-resistant membranes were initially assumed to be identical to membrane rafts, because of similarities between their compositions. In fact, the impact of detergents in membrane organization is still controversial. Here, we use phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy to observe giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) made of erythrocyte membrane lipids (erythro-GUVs) when exposed to the detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100). We clearly show that TX-100 has a restructuring action on biomembranes. Contact with TX-100 readily induces domain formation on the previously homogeneous membrane of erythro-GUVs at physiological and room temperatures. The shape and dynamics of the formed domains point to liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered (Lo/Ld) phase separation, typically found in raft-like ternary lipid mixtures. The Ld domains are then separated from the original vesicle and completely solubilized by TX-100. The insoluble vesicle left, in the Lo phase, represents around 2/3 of the original vesicle surface at room temperature and decreases to almost 1/2 at physiological temperature. This chain of events could be entirely reproduced with biomimetic GUVs of a simple ternary lipid mixture, 2:1:2 POPC/SM/chol (phosphatidylcholine/sphyngomyelin/cholesterol), showing that this behavior will arise because of fundamental physicochemical properties of simple lipid mixtures. This work provides direct visualization of TX-100-induced domain formation followed by selective (Ld phase) solubilization in a model system with a complex biological lipid composition.","2014-06-03","2017-04-04 14:32:36","2017-11-09 17:38:09","","2417-2425","","11","106","","Biophys.

However their structure, size and stability are still controversial. Given that detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) are in the liquid-ordered state and are rich in raft-like components, they might correspond to rafts at least to some extent. Here we monitor the lateral order of biological membranes by characterizing DRMs from erythrocytes obtained with Brij-98, Brij-58, and TX-100 at 4 °C and 37 °C. All DRMs were enriched in cholesterol and contained the raft markers flotillin-2 and stomatin. However, sphingomyelin (SM) was only found to be enriched in TX-100-DRMs - a detergent that preferentially solubilizes the membrane inner leaflet - while Band 3 was present solely in Brij-DRMs. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra showed that the acyl chain packing of Brij-DRMs was lower than TX-100-DRMs, providing evidence of their diverse lipid composition. Fatty acid analysis revealed that the SM fraction of the DRMs was enriched in lignoceric acid, which should specifically contribute to the resistance of SM to detergents. These results indicate that lipids from the outer leaflet, particularly SM, are essential for the formation of the liquid-ordered phase of DRMs. At last, the differential solubilization process induced by Brij-98 and TX-100 was monitored using giant unilamellar vesicles. This study suggests that Brij and TX-100-DRMs reflect different degrees of lateral order of the membrane microdomains. Additionally, Brij DRMs are composed by both inner and outer leaflet components, making them more physiologically relevant than TX-100-DRMs to the studies of membrane rafts.","2014-09","2017-03-28 14:25:38","2017-11-09 17:37:32","","195-205","","6","31","","Mol.

(1)H NMR relaxation times revealed two contributing components in each proton system (PEG, phospholipids, and water), for all the mixtures studied, exhibiting values of T1 with very different orders of magnitude. This allowed identifying confined and bulk water populations as well as PEG moieties becoming more disordered and independent from the phospholipid moiety as n increased. (31)P spectra showed a typical broad bilayer signal for n = 350 and 1000, and an isotropic signal characteristic of micelles for n = 5000. Surface pressure (π)-molecular area isotherms and compressional modulus measurements provided further structural information. Moreover, epifluorescence microscopy data from monolayers at π ∼ 30 mN/m, the expected equilibrium π in lipid bilayers, allowed us to postulate that both (1)H populations resolved through NMR in phospholipids and lipopolymers corresponded to different phase domains.","2014-06-12","2017-11-09 17:30:03","2017-11-09 17:30:03","","6150-6158","","23","118","","J Phys Chem B","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24810785","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810785","","Lipid Bilayers; Micelles; Polyethylene Glycols; 1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; Dermoscopy; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Molecular Structure; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Phosphorus Isotopes; Pressure; Protons; Surface Properties; Suspensions; Water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The PEG chains covered a wide molecular mass range (350, 1000 and 5000Da). In surface pressure-area (π-A), isotherms PE-PEG(1000) and PE-PEG(5000) showed transitions (midpoints at πm,t1∼11mN/m, ""t1""), which appeared as a long non-horizontal line region. Thus, t1 cannot be considered a first-order phase transition but may reflect a transition within the polymer, comprising its desorption from the air-water interface and compaction upon compression. This is supported by the increase in the νs(C-O-C) PM-IRRAS signal intensity and the increasing surface potentials at maximal compression, which reflect thicker polymeric layers. Furthermore, changes in hydrocarbon chain (HC) packing and tilt with respect to the surface led to reorientation in the PO2(-) group upon compression, indicated by the inversion of the νasym(PO2(-)) PM-IRRAS signal around t1. The absence of a t1 in PE-PEG(350) supports the requisite of a critical polymer chain length for this transition to occur. In-situ epifluorescence microscopy revealed 2D-domain-like structures in PE-PEG(1000) and PE-PEG(5000) around t1, possibly associated with gelation/dehydration of the polymeric layer and appearing at decreasing π as the polymeric tail became longer. Another transition, t2, appearing in PE-PEG(350) and PE-PEG(1000) at πm,t2=29.4 and 34.8mN/m, respectively, was associated with HC condensation and was impaired in PE-PEG(5000) due to steric hindrance imposed by the large size of its polymer moiety. Two critical lengths of polymer chains were found, one of which allowed the onset of polymeric-tail gelation and the other limited HC compaction.","2016-12-01","2017-11-09 17:29:41","2017-11-09 17:29:41","","640-649","","","148","","Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27697738","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697738","","Temperature; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymers; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Pressure; Surface Properties; Water; Air; BAM; EFM; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Langmuir films; Mixing behavior; Models, Chemical; PE-PEG; PM-IRRAS; Polymer grafted lipids; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Surface aggregation; Thermodynamics; Unilamellar Liposomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, because of the complex composition of biomembranes, their solubilization by detergents has not been systematically studied. In this review, we address the solubilization of erythrocytes, which provide a relatively simple, robust and easy to handle biomembrane, and of biomimetic models, to stress the role of the lipid composition on the solubilization process. First, results of a systematic study on the solubilization of human erythrocyte membranes by different series of non-ionic (Triton, CxEy, Brij, Renex, Tween), anionic (bile salts) and zwitterionic (ASB, CHAPS) detergents are shown. Such quantitative approach allowed us to propose Resat—the effective detergent/lipid molar ratio in the membrane for the onset of hemolysis as a new parameter to classify the solubilization efficiency of detergents. Second, detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) obtained as a result of the partial solubilization of erythrocytes by TX-100, C12E8 and Brij detergents are examined. DRMs were characterized by their cholesterol, sphingolipid and specific proteins content, as well as lipid packing. Finally, lipid bilayers of tuned lipid composition forming liposomes were used to investigate the solubilization process of membranes of different compositions/phases induced by Triton X-100. Optical microscopy of giant unilamellar vesicles revealed that pure phospholipid membranes are fully solubilized, whereas the presence of cholesterol renders the mixture partially or even fully insoluble, depending on the composition. Additionally, Triton X-100 induced phase separation in raft-like mixtures, and selective solubilization of the fluid phase only.","2017-08-23","2017-10-16 18:15:17","2017-10-16 18:15:17","2017-10-16 18:15:17","1-19","","","","","Biophys Rev","Biophysical approaches in the study of biomembrane solubilization","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/P3SMS2MZ/Riske et al. - 2017 - Biophysical approaches in the study of biomembrane.pdf; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/JBW7NC7I/10.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Erythrocyte membrane characteristics and its association with the cell cytoskeleton are presented in order to complete understanding of the erythrocyte membrane distortion. Cell homeostasis disturbances caused by surfactants might induce changes starting from shape modification to cell lysis. Two main mechanisms are hypothesized in literature which are osmotic lysis and lysis by solubilization even if the boundary between them is not clearly defined. Another specific mechanism based on the formation of membrane pores is suggested in the particular case of saponins. The lytic potency of a surfactant is related to its affinity for the membrane and the modification of the lipid membrane curvature. This is to be related to the surfactant shape defined by its hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties but also by experimental conditions. As a consequence, prediction of the hemolytic potency of a given surfactant is challenging. Several studies are focused on the relation between surfactant erythrolytic potency and their physico-chemical parameters such as the critical micellar concentration (CMC), the hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB), the surfactant membrane/water partition coefficient (K) or the packing parameter (P). The CMC is one of the most important factors considered even if a lytic activity cut-off effect points out that the only consideration of CMC not enough predictive. The relation K.CMC must be considered in addition to the CMC to predict the surfactant lytic capacity within the same family of non ionic surfactant. Those surfactant structure/lytic activity studies demonstrate the requirement to take into account a combination of physico-chemical parameters to understand and foresee surfactant lytic potency.","2016-02","2017-08-08 12:36:58","2019-07-05 01:25:31","","1-16","","","228","","Adv Colloid Interface Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26687805","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26687805; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26687805","","Animals; Erythrocyte Membrane; Hemolysis; Humans; Micelles; Physico-chemical parameters; Saponins; Surface-Active Agents; Surfactants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present a detailed analysis of the energetics and thermodynamics of vesiculation by recourse to nonlinear elasticity, taking into account large deformation that may arise during the vesiculation process. The effects of membrane size, spontaneous curvature, and membrane stiffness on vesiculation and vesicle size distribution were investigated, and the critical size for vesicle formation was determined and found to compare favorably with available experimental evidence. Our analysis also showed that the critical membrane size for spontaneous vesiculation was correlated with membrane thickness, and further illustrated how the combined effects of membrane thickness and physical properties influenced the size, shape, and distribution of vesicles. These findings shed light on the formation of physiological extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes. The findings also suggest pathways for manipulating the size, shape, distribution, and physical properties of synthetic vesicles, with potential applications in vesicle physiology, the pathobiology of cancer and other diseases, diagnostics using in vivo liquid biopsy, and drug delivery methods.","2017-03-14","2017-08-08 12:34:14","2017-08-08 12:34:14","","2910-2915","","11","114","","Proc.

In the ternary mixture, the surface adsorption is dominated by C12E8 and LAS, and there is little SLES at the interface. The departure from ideality in the binary mixtures can be quantitatively described by applying the pseudophase approximation with quadratic and cubic terms in the excess free energy of mixing (GE) both at the surface and in the micelles. The same parameters that describe the binary interactions give a quantitative fit to the adsorbed fractions in the ternary mixture over a wide range of composition. A similar analysis is effective for the mixture containing sodium dodecyl sulfate instead of SLES. Of the set of six GE required to fit the ternary data, one is ideal (SLES–LAS) and three, LAS–C12E8 (micelle) and C12E8–SLES (micelle and surface), have minima occurring at a composition (mole fraction) of the anionic species of 1/3.","2017-04-06","2017-08-04 15:13:43","2017-08-04 15:13:43","2017-08-04 15:13:43","2825-2838","","13","121","","J.

Specific heat capacity, electric capacitance and resistance, and optical transmittance (280 nm) sustained sharp changes at 49°C (TA) and 66°C (TC), the known denaturation temperatures of spectrin and band 3, respectively. The change at TA was selectively inhibited by diamide (1 mM) and taurine mustard (1 mM) while its inducing temperature was selectively decreased by formamide in full concert with the assumed involvement of spectrin denaturation. In the residues of EGMs, pretreated with 4,4'-diiso-thiocyanato stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), the change at TC was shifted from 66 to 78°C which indicated the involvement of band 3 denaturation. The freeze and rapid thaw of EGM residues resulted in a strong reduction of cooperativity of band 3 denaturation while the slow thaw completely eliminated the peak of this denaturation. These effects of freeze-thaw were prevented in residues obtained from DIDS-treated EGMs. The freeze-thaw of residues slightly affected spectrin denaturation at 49°C although an additional denaturation appeared at 55°C. The results indicate preserved molecular structure and dynamics of the membrane skeleton in Triton-X-100 extracts of EGMs. The freeze-thaw inflicted strong damage on band 3 and spectrin-actin skeleton of EGM extracts which is relevant to cryobiology, cryosurgery and cryopreservation of cells.","2017-04","2017-06-22 19:09:48","2019-07-05 01:25:22","","155-165","","2","36","","Gen.

In science, imaging is potentiated by optical and electron microscopy. However, living and soft matter are not still. Thus, biological preparations for microscopy usually include a fixation step. Similarly, immobilization strategies are required for or substantially facilitate imaging of cells or lipid vesicles, and even more so for acquiring high-quality data via fluorescence-based techniques. Here, we describe a simple yet efficient method to immobilize objects such as lipid vesicles with sizes between 0.1 and 100 μm using agarose gel. We show that while large and giant unilamellar vesicles (LUVs and GUVs) can be caged in the pockets of the gel meshwork, small molecules, proteins and micelles remain free to diffuse through the gel and interact with membranes as in agarose-free solutions, and complex biochemical reactions involving several proteins can proceed in the gel. At the same time, immobilization in agarose has no adverse effect on the GUV size and stability. By applying techniques such as FRAP and FCS, we show that the lateral diffusion of lipids is not affected by the gel. Finally, our immobilization strategy allows capturing high-resolution 3D images of GUVs.","2016-05-03","2017-06-20 14:06:06","2017-06-21 15:47:31","","25254","","","6","","Sci Rep","Posing for a picture","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27140695 PMCID: PMC4853705","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140695; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140695","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The knowledge of erythrocyte membrane structure is important because it represents the model for spectrin-based membrane skeletons in all cells and because defects in its structure underlie multiple hemolytic anemias. This review summarizes the main features of erythrocyte membrane disorders, dividing them into structural and altered permeability defects, focusing particularly on the most recent advances. New proteins involved in alterations of the red blood cell membrane permeability were recently described. The mechanoreceptor PIEZO1 is the largest ion channel identified to date, the fundamental regulator of erythrocyte volume homeostasis. Missense, gain-of-function mutations in the PIEZO1 gene have been identified in several families as causative of dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis. Similarly, the KCNN4 gene, codifying the so called Gardos channel, has been recently identified as a second causative gene of hereditary xerocytosis. Finally, ABCB6 missense mutations were identified in different pedigrees of familial pseudohyperkalemia. New genomic technologies have improved the quality and reduced the time of diagnosis of these diseases. Moreover, they are essential for the identification of the new causative genes. However, many questions remain to solve, and are currently objects of intensive studies.","2016-11-01","2017-06-21 00:41:10","2017-06-21 01:27:16","2017-06-21 00:41:10","1284-1294","","11","101","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright© Ferrata Storti Foundation","","","","www.haematologica.org","","PMID: 27756835","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/ZPCA4K6W/Andolfo et al. - 2016 - New insights on hereditary erythrocyte membrane de.pdf; ; ; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/VDKUZQSP/1284.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756835; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756835","","Erythrocyte Membrane; Humans; Spherocytosis, Hereditary; Cell Membrane Permeability; Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital; Hydrops Fetalis; Hyperkalemia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using visible light, we stretch the vesicles, increasing the membrane tension until the membrane responds by the sudden opening of a large pore (several micrometers in size). Only a single pore is observed at a time in a given vesicle. However, a cascade of transient pores appear, up to 30-40 in succession, in the same vesicle. These pores are transient: they reseal within a few seconds as the inner liquid leaks out. The membrane tension, which is the driving force for pore opening, is relaxed with the opening of a pore and the leakage of the inner liquid; the line tension of the pore's edge is then able to drive the closure of a pore. We use fluorescent membrane probes and real-time videomicroscopy to study the dynamics of the pores. These can be visualized only if the vesicles are prepared in a viscous solution to slow down the leakout of the internal liquid. From measurements of the closure velocity of the pores, we are able to infer the line tension,. We have studied the effect of the shape of inclusion molecules on. Cholesterol, which can be modeled as an inverted cone-shaped molecule, increases the line tension when incorporated into the bilayers. Conversely, addition of cone-shaped detergents reduces. The effect of some detergents can be dramatic, reducing by two orders of magnitude, and increasing pore lifetimes up to several minutes. We give some examples of transport through transient pores and present a rough measurement of the leakout velocity of the inner liquid through a pore. We discuss how our results can be extended to less viscous aqueous solutions which are more relevant for biological systems and biotechnological applications.","2003-03","2017-06-20 21:46:07","2017-06-20 21:46:07","","1734-1749","","3","84","","Biophys.

Negatively charged lipids do not form liposomes without field when the thickness of the dried lipid layer is of the order or less than that corresponding to 90 bilayers. The rate and extent of swelling of layers thicker than 90 bilayers is largest on the cathode, smaller without fields and smallest on the anode. The theory, based on the assumption that osmotic and electrostatic forces drive lipid swelling and liposome formation, is in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data; in particular, it gives the observed linear dependence of the rate of swelling on the inverse lipid layer thickness. To induce liposome formation for layers thinner than 90 bilayers it was necessary to apply a negative potential which is proportional to the logarithm of the inversed layer thickness. The characteristic critical potential is proportional to RTk/F; R being the gas constant, Tk the absolute temperature and F the Faraday constant. This indicates that redistribution of counterions may be the cause which increases the repulsive electrostatic intermembrane forces to overcome van der Waals attraction. For thicknesses below 10 bilayers, formation of very thin-walled liposomes of narrow size distribution and mean diameter of the order of 30 µm was observed. These liposomes grow in size before detachment and a formula for the kinetics of growth has been derived, which is in very good agreement with the experimental data. The effects of d.c. fields on DMPC swelling are smaller and lead to formation of liposome-like structures of different appearence. Bilayer separation and bending are prerequisites for liposome formation from hydrating lipids. Therefore, a possible molecular mechanism is that membranes should be destabilized to bend and fuse to form liposomes. This requires the right proportion between structured regions, in the form of bilayers, and defects and/or non-bilayer structures, and in many cases external constraints, in particular, electrical fields.","1986-01-01","2017-06-20 21:14:19","2017-06-20 21:14:19","2017-06-20 21:14:19","303-311","","0","81","","Faraday Discuss.

These insoluble fragments are enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and certain proteins having a preference for more organized environments. Here we investigated the effect of detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100) on raft-like lipid mixtures composed of POPC (palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, an unsaturated lipid), SM (sphingomyelin, a saturated lipid), and cholesterol, focusing on the detergent-induced phase separation at subsolubilizing concentration and the extent of solubilization at higher concentration. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of POPC/SM/chol containing a fluorescent probe known to prefer the liquid-disordered phase were prepared and observed with fluorescence microscopy. A phase diagram constructed in the presence and absence of 0.1 mM TX-100 showed that the detergent induces macroscopic liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered (Lo/Ld) phase separation over a wide range of membrane composition, indicating that TX-100 has the ability to rearrange the lateral heterogeneity of the lipid mixture. The extent of solubilization of the POPC/SM/chol GUVs was quantified by measuring the vesicle size before and after the injection of a high concentration of TX-100. In parallel, the solubilization extent of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) was assessed by turbidity measurements. The extent of solubilization decreases significantly as the fractions of SM and cholesterol in the mixture increase. The origin of the detergent resistance is the low partitioning of TX-100 in cholesterol-rich membranes, especially in SM-containing ones, as evidenced by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments on LUVs. Our results provide a guide to future research on the effects of TX-100 on raft-like lipid mixtures.","2017-05-11","2017-06-15 16:23:22","2017-06-15 16:23:22","","","","","","","Langmuir","Effect of Triton X-100 on Raft-Like Lipid Mixtures","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28474888","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474888","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore relevant to study and understand the mechanistic details underlying detergent-lipid interactions using biomimetic systems. Here, we have investigated in detail the process of membrane permeabilization and the nature of pores induced by sub-solubilizing concentrations of the detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100) in bilayers composed of palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and binary mixtures of these phospholipids with 30 mol% cholesterol (chol). A fluorescence quenching assay was used to evaluate the permeability of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) in the presence of increasing concentrations of TX-100. Confocal microscopy was employed to visualize and quantify the permeability of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to two fluorescent dyes of different sizes in the presence of TX-100. Both methods showed that POPC, POPC/chol and SM membranes become fully permeable at a specific TX-100 concentration, followed by complete (POPC and SM) and partial (POPC/chol) solubilization at a higher detergent concentration. The confocal microscopy experiments revealed that opening of pores occurs as a well-defined event and that for POPC and POPC/chol the pores were initially selective to the small probe and then grew and allowed passage of the larger dye as well. On the other hand, the insoluble SM/chol membranes exhibited only a mild TX-100-induced permeabilization. The membrane edge tension of the liquid phases was measured from the closure rate of macropores induced by electric pulses in GUVs. Membrane edge tension was shown to be sensitive to membrane composition and to decrease in the presence of TX-100. We propose that extensive permeabilization occurs below a critical membrane edge tension, which is eventually reached in the partially and fully soluble compositions, but not in the insoluble mixture.","2017-01","2017-06-15 16:22:51","2017-06-15 16:22:51","","28-37","","","202","","Chem.

Peculiar properties, such as sample transparency, are observed only in the transition region. In this work we use differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), turbidity, and optical microscopy to study the narrowing of the transition region with the increase of ionic strength (0−500 mM NaCl). Upon addition of salt, the temperature extension of the transition region is reduced, and the number of calorimetric peaks decreases until a single cooperative event at Tm = 23 °C is observed in the presence of 500 mM NaCl. The transition region is always coupled with a decrease in turbidity, but a transparent region is detected within the melting process only in the presence of up to 20 mM NaCl. The vanishing of the transparent region is associated with one of the calorimetric peaks. Optical microscopy of giant vesicles shows that bilayers first rupture when the transition region is reached and subsequently lose optical contrast. Fluorescence microscopy reveals a blurry and undefined image in the transparent region, suggesting a different lipid self-assembly. Overall sample turbidity can be directly related to the bilayer optical contrast. Our observations are discussed in terms of the bilayer being perforated along the transition region. In the narrower temperature interval of the transparent region, dependent on the ionic strength, the perforation is extensive and the bilayer completely loses the optical contrast.","2009-09-01","2017-06-14 17:28:55","2017-06-14 17:28:55","","10083-10091","","17","25","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/FX6P4Q6I/la9012137.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lipid vesicles are the most popular model membrane systems for studying biophysical and biological processes in living cells. Furthermore, as vesicles are made from biocompatible and biodegradable materials, they provide a strategy to create safe and functionalized drug delivery systems in health-care applications. Exposure of lipid vesicles to pulsed electric fields is a common physical method to transiently increase the permeability of the lipid membrane. This method, termed electroporation, has shown many advantages for delivering exogenous molecules including drugs and genetic material into vesicles and living cells. In addition, electroporation can be applied to induce fusion between vesicles and/or cells. First, we discuss in detail how research on cell-size GUVs as model cell systems has provided novel insight into the basic mechanisms of cell electroporation and associated phenomena. Afterwards, we continue with a thorough overview how electroporation and electrofusion have been used as versatile methods to manipulate vesicles of all sizes in different biomedical applications. We conclude by summarizing the open questions in the field of electroporation and possible future directions for vesicles in the biomedical field.","","2017-06-13 15:47:09","2017-06-13 15:47:09","","","","","","","Advances in Colloid and Interface Science","Lipid vesicles in pulsed electric fields","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/6VNB6XI2/S0001868617300921.html","","","Artificial cell; Drug delivery vehicle; Electrofusion; Electroporation; Lipid vesicle; Microreactor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parameters measured included vesicle size and surface charge, BTB fluorescence anisotropy, encapsulation efficiency, partition coefficient and liposomal membrane organization. Encapsulation efficiencies and membrane/water partition coefficients were determined using a phase separation. The partition coefficients of the elastic and conventional formulations were 2025 ± 234 and 1136 ± 241, respectively. The sizes of the elastic and conventional liposomes did not change significantly (p > 0.05) following incorporation of the anesthetic. As expected, the elastic liposomes presented order parameters that were lower than those of the conventional liposomes, as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance with a 5-stearic acid nitroxide probe incorporated into the bilayer. After 8 h, the fluxes into the receiving solution (µg/cm(2)/h) were 6.95 ± 1.60 (10% BTB), 23.17 ± 6.09 (10% BTBLUV) and 29.93 ± 6.54 (10% BTBLUV-EL). The corresponding time lags (h) were 1.90 ± 0.48, 1.23 ± 0.28 and 1.57 ± 0.38, respectively. The permeability coefficients (10(-3 )cm/h) were 1.02 ± 0.23, 2.96 ± 0.77 and 4.14 ± 0.9, for 10% BTB, 10% BTBLUV and 10% BTBLUV-EL, respectively. The results demonstrate that anesthetic access through the skin can be considerably enhanced using liposomal gel formulations, compared to plain gel formulations.","2013-09","2017-04-04 14:29:04","2017-06-07 13:44:18","","228-234","","3","23","","J Liposome Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23697904","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23697904","","Liposomes; Animals; Administration, Cutaneous; Anesthetics, Local; Benzocaine; Drug Compounding; Elasticity; Fluorescence Polarization; Gels; Particle Size; Reproducibility of Results; Skin Absorption; Swine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, measuring protein denaturation in cells under conditions relevant to heat shock presents problems due to cellular complexity and high levels of light scattering that interfere with optical techniques. A general method for measuring protein denaturation in cells using high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is given. Profiles of specific heat (c(p) vs. temperature) are obtained providing information about transitions in cellular components including the denaturation of proteins. The specific approaches employed with erythrocytes, bacteria, and mammalian cells are described, and an identification of several features of the DSC profiles is given. Protein denaturation on the level of roughly 7-20% occurs for commonly used heat shocks in mammalian cells.","2005-02","2018-05-29 00:35:42","2018-05-29 00:35:42","","117-125","","2","35","","Methods","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 15649838","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15649838","","Erythrocytes; Humans; Animals; Temperature; Proteins; Hot Temperature; Protein Denaturation; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; HeLa Cells; Light; Protein Conformation; Scattering, Radiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Membranes, undergoing HTP at conditions sparing the structure of spectrin (39°C, 18%, v/v ethanol, 3min), became irreversibly permeabilized for NaCl but retained impermeability for sucrose. SDS-PAGE and thermal gel analysis did not detect denaturation of tertiary structure of membrane proteins. The denaturation temperature of spectrin did not change, whereas that of the anion exchanger, band 3 protein, decreased by 2.5°C compared to that of control. Specific inhibition of the anion exchanger with 4,4′-diiso-thiocyanato stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) prior to or after permeabilization increased the denaturation temperature to 76.5°C, which was still lower by 3.5°C than that of inhibited intact membranes.

Covalent inhibitors include the amino reactive agents 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, pyridoxal phosphate and 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitro benzene. The non-covalent inhibitors include several well known local anesthetics. The study was underataken in order to identify regions of the membrane involved in anion transport. Covalent modification in all case resulted in a large upward shift of the C transition, which is beleived to involve a localized phospholipid region. Evidence is presented which indicates that Band III protein and this phospholipid region are in close physical proximity on the membrane. Addition of non-covalent inhibitors affects the membrane in either or both of two ways. In some cases, a lowering and broadening of the C transition occurs; in others the B1 and B2 transitions are altered. These latter transitions are beleived to involve both phospholipid and protein, including Band III. These results may indicate that the non-covalent inhibitors produce their inhibitory effect on anion transport at least in part by interacting with membrane phospholipid.","1978-10-04","2018-05-29 16:00:20","2018-05-29 16:00:20","","579-591","","3","512","","Biochim.

Studies of the B and C transitions","Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta","","0006-3002","","","Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to study several structural transitions of the human erythrocyte membrane. Earlier studies have shown that one of these transitions (the A transition) is due to the thermal unfolding of spectrin on the membrane. In this paper, it is shown that two of the other transitions (B and C) exhibit a high sensitivity to a local anesthetic, benzyl alcohol. Increasing the ionic strength of the suspending medium results in a splitting of the B transition into two indepent transitions (B1 and B2). It is found that one of these (B2) is associated with titrating groups, since the midpoint for the transitions shifts by about 20 degrees C, with an apparent pK near 7.5 Extensive bilateral proteolysis by papain causes a drastic decrease in the size of all transitions except the C transition, which remains unaltered. On the other hand, treatment with phospholipase by A2 largely affects the C transition, causing its disappearance. Because of the lack of sensitivity to proteolysis and the high sensitivity to phospholipase, it appears that the C transition has a large extent of 'lipid involvement'. It might result from the melting of a small fraction of phospholipid which exists in a crystalline state under physiological conditions. Alternatively, the C transition could arise from changes in protein-lipid interactions or from lipid-dependent changes in protein-protein interactions, providing one assumes that only protease-resistant portions of membrane proteins are participating.","1978-10-04","2018-05-29 15:53:34","2018-05-29 15:53:34","","566-578","","3","512","","Biochim.

The dependence of the wave growth on ionic strength and surface charge was broadly consistent with theoretical predictions for the growth of a displacement instability on a low interfacial tension interface.

In the present paper we reported five new compounds with activity against these protozoan parasites, and quite low cytotoxicity. Moreover, the interference of plasma membrane permeability of these analogues were also evaluated. We found that [(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]octylamine (4) was noteworthy due to its high activity against the amastigote form of both parasites (IC50 1.3-5.8 μM) and good selectivity index. In order to unveil the SAR for this chemotype, we also presented a group efficiency analysis and PCA and HCA study, which indicated that the methoxyl provides good activity with lower cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. The results from SAR analyses suggest different mechanisms of action between the neutral and basic compounds. In summary, the analogues represent important activity against these parasites and must be prototypes for further exploitation.","2018-09-15","2018-08-06 23:43:18","2018-08-06 23:43:18","","31-41","","","122","","Eur J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29935351","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935351","","Anti-trypanosoma; Group efficiency; Leishmanicide; Natural product analogues; SAR analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result of highly toxic and long-duration treatments, novel, safe and more efficacious drugs are essential. In this work, the methanol (MeOH) extract from the leaves of Piper malacophyllum (Piperaceae) was fractioned to afford one alkenylphenol, which was characterized as 4-[(3'E)-decenyl]phenol (gibbilimbol B) by spectroscopic methods. Anti-protozoan in vitro assays demonstrated for the first time that Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi was susceptible to gibbilimbol B, with an in vitro EC(50) of 23 μg/mL against axenic promastigotes and an EC(50) of 22 μg/mL against intracellular amastigotes. Gibbilimbol B was also tested for anti-trypanosomal activity (Trypanosoma cruzi) and showed an EC(50) value of 17 μg/mL against trypomastigotes. To evaluate the cytotoxic parameters, this alkenylphenol was tested in vitro against NCTC cells, showing a CC(50) of 59 μg/mL and absent hemolytic activity at the highest concentration of 75 μg/mL. Using the fluorescent probe SYTOX Green suggested that the alkenylphenol disrupted the Leishmania plasma membrane upon initial incubation. Further drug design studies aiming at derivatives could be a promising tool for the development of new therapeutic agents for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.","2012-11","2018-08-06 23:43:36","2019-07-05 01:25:51","","383-387","","3","132","","Exp.

The disease is endemic in all continental Latin American countries, but has become a worldwide problem because of migration of infected individuals to developed countries, mainly in Europe and North America. Chagas cardiomyopathy results from the combined effects of persistent parasitism, parasite-driven tissue inflammation, microvascular and neurogenic dysfunction, and autoimmune responses triggered by the infection. Clinical presentation varies widely according to the extent of myocardial damage, and manifests mainly as three basic syndromes that can coexist in an individual patient: heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. NYHA functional class, left ventricular systolic function, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are important prognostic markers of the risk of death. Management of Chagas cardiomyopathy focuses on the treatment of the three main syndromes. The use of β-blockers in patients with Chagas disease and heart failure is safe, well tolerated, and should be encouraged. Most specialists and international institutions now recommend specific antitrypanosomal treatment of patients with chronic Chagas disease, even in the absence of evidence obtained from randomized clinical trials.

Despite this, in a recent clinical trial it displayed limited curative potential. Drug testing is problematic in experimental Chagas disease because of difficulties in demonstrating sterile cure, particularly during the chronic stage of infection when parasite burden is extremely low and tissue distribution is ill defined. To better assess posaconazole efficacy against acute and chronic Chagas disease, we have exploited a highly sensitive bioluminescence imaging system which generates data with greater accuracy than other methods, including PCR-based approaches. Mice inoculated with bioluminescent T. cruzi were assessed by in vivo and ex vivo imaging, with cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression used to enhance the detection of relapse. Posaconazole was found to be significantly inferior to benznidazole as a treatment for both acute and chronic T. cruzi infections. Whereas 20 days treatment with benznidazole was 100% successful in achieving sterile cure, posaconazole failed in almost all cases. Treatment of chronic infections with posaconazole did however significantly reduce infection-induced splenomegaly, even in the absence of parasitological cure. The imaging-based screening system also revealed that adipose tissue is a major site of recrudescence in mice treated with posaconazole in the acute, but not the chronic stage of infection. This in vivo screening model for Chagas disease is predictive, reproducible and adaptable to diverse treatment schedules. It should provide greater assurance that drugs are not advanced prematurely into clinical trial.","2015-08","2018-08-07 17:28:22","2018-08-07 17:28:22","","4653-4661","","8","59","","Antimicrob.

Although it was first identified more than a century ago, only two old drugs are available for treatment and a lot of questions related to the disease progression, its pathologies, and not to mention the assessment of treatment efficacy, are subject to debate and remain to be answered. Indeed, the current status of evidence and data available does not allow any absolute statement related to treatment needs and outcome for Chagas patients to be made. Although there has been some new impetus in Research and Development for Chagas disease following recent new clinical trials, there is a scientific requirement to review and challenge the current status of evidence and define basic and clinical research priorities and next steps in the field.

Vector control is an essential component, but innovation in this field is insufficient. Substantial progress has been made in the area of diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine development, but there are still many hurdles to overcome. For visceral leishmaniasis elimination to become a reality, effective deployment of these existing and new tools is essential. A strong commitment at community level is imperative, and appropriate diagnostic and treatment services as well as effective epidemiological surveillance need to be ensured.","2016-12","2018-08-07 18:04:51","2018-08-07 18:04:51","","e304-e309","","12","16","","Lancet Infect Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27692643 PMCID: PMC5177523","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27692643","","Humans; Animals; Leishmaniasis, Visceral; Antiprotozoal Agents; Amphotericin B; Health Services Accessibility; India; Insect Control; Insect Vectors; Neglected Diseases; Phosphorylcholine; Psychodidae; Public Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among those used for drug and gene delivery, lipid-based nanoparticles are receiving great attention in the literature, especially solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). These lipid nanoparticles (LN) are typically described as having a solid core coated with surfactant molecules. They have several advantages over other nanoparticles, including protection of drugs from chemical degradation, protection of genetic material against enzymatic degradation, high stability (beyond 3 years), and they are easy to scale up and sterilize. They benefit from the combined advantages of liposomes and emulsions, while minimizing their drawbacks. However, their inner structures are not fully understood, and knowledge about their internal cores can help to better tailor their ability to carry out specific roles. In this chapter, we focus on the physicochemical aspects of LN (SLN and NLC) cores and how their inner structures influence their role as drug and gene delivery systems.","2016-01-01","2018-08-08 18:23:30","2018-08-08 18:23:30","2018-08-08 18:23:30","1-42","","","24","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/bs.abl.2016.04.001","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/V73BIV5V/S2451963416300012.html","","","Drug delivery; Gene delivery; Lipid nanoparticles; Nanomedicine; Nanostructured lipid carriers; Solid lipid nanoparticles","Iglič, Aleš; Kulkarni, Chandrashekhar V.; Rappolt, Michael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the high frequency of injection and the high cost of the therapeutics, there is a need to develop new ways in which to deliver these therapeutics: ways which are both safer and more cost effective. AREAS COVERED: Using the most common PSED, age-related macular degeneration, as an example of a debilitating ocular disease, this review examines the key barriers limiting the delivery of macromolecular therapeutics to the posterior segment of the eye and defines the key requirements placed on particulate drug delivery vehicles (DDVs) to be suitable for this application. Recent developments in macromolecular drug delivery to treat this disease as well as the remaining shortcomings in its treatment are surveyed. Lastly, an emerging class of DDVs potentially suited to this application, called cubosomes, is introduced. EXPERT OPINION: Based on their excellent colloidal stability and high internal surface area, cubosomes hold great potential for the sustained release of therapeutics. Novel production methods and a better understanding of the mechanisms through which drug release from these particles can be controlled are two major recent developments toward successful application.","2015","2018-08-08 18:49:10","2018-08-08 18:49:10","","1513-1526","","9","12","","Expert Opin Drug Deliv","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25745885","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25745885","","Humans; Drug Delivery Systems; Animals; age-related macular degeneration; cubosome; Drug Liberation; Excipients; Eye; Macromolecular Substances; Macular Degeneration; ocular drug delivery; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Posterior Eye Segment; posterior segment eye disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cubosome composition can be tuned to engineer pore sizes or include bioactive lipids, the polymer outer corona can be used for targeting and they are highly stable under physiological conditions. The structure provides a significantly higher membrane surface area for loading of membrane proteins and small drug molecules than liposomes. Due to recent advances, they can be engineered in vitro in both bulk and nanoparticle formats with applications including drug delivery, membrane bioreactors, artificial cells and biosensors.

We explored the phase behavior of lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) mesophases composed by monoolein/oleic acid/water for enhanced administration of donepezil. Polarized light microscopy suggested that these systems ranged from isotropic inverse micellar solutions (L2) to viscous and birefringent reverse hexagonal (HII) mesophases according to the amount of water in the ternary systems. Phase transition was observed from a L2 phase to HII mesophase after swelling studies, an interesting property to be explored as a precursor of LLC mesophases for mucosal administration that increases its viscosity in situ. Mucoadhesive properties of LLC mesophases were characterized using a texture analyzer indicating that these systems can have an increased residence time in the site of absorption. Donepezil-free base was incorporated in the evaluated formulations, and their in vitro release was controlled up to 24 h. The phase behavior of the systems demonstrated a great potential for enhanced donepezil administration once these mucoadhesive-controlled release formulations can incorporate the drug and prolong its release, possibly reducing its side effects.","2016-01","2018-08-08 19:36:23","2018-08-08 19:36:23","","71-77","","1","105","","J Pharm Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26852841","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26852841","","Humans; Animals; In Vitro Techniques; Water; Solubility; Swine; Drug Liberation; Adhesiveness; Alzheimer Disease; biomaterials; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; controlled release/delivery; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Carriers; Glycerides; Indans; Intestinal Mucosa; lipids; mathematic model; microemulsion; Models, Theoretical; mucosal drug delivery; Nanostructures; Oleic Acid; oral drug delivery; Phase Transition; Piperidines; transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The simvastatin-loaded cubic nanoparticles were prepared through fragmentation of the GMO/poloxamer 407 bulk cubic-phase gel using high-pressure homogenization. The internal structure of the cubic nanoparticles was identified by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The mean diameter of the cubic nanoparticles varied within the range of 100–150 nm, and both GMO/poloxamer 407 ratio and theoretical drug loading had no significant effect on particle size and distribution. Almost complete entrapment with efficiency over 98% was achieved due to the high affinity of simvastatin to the hydrophobic regions of the cubic phase. Release of simvastatin from the cubic nanoparticles was limited both in 0.1 M hydrochloride solution containing 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate and fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid with a total release of <3.0% at 10 h. Pharmacokinetic profiles in beagle dogs showed sustained plasma levels of simvastatin for cubic nanoparticles over 12 h. The relative oral bioavailability of simvastatin cubic nanoparticles calculated on the basis of area under the curve was 241% compared to simvastatin crystal powder. The enhancement of simvastatin bioavailability was possibly attributable to facilitated absorption by lipids in the formulation rather than improved release.","2009-07-28","2018-08-08 19:37:24","2018-08-08 19:37:24","2018-08-08 19:37:24","","","3","10","","AAPS PharmSciTech","Glyceryl Monooleate/Poloxamer 407 Cubic Nanoparticles as Oral Drug Delivery Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 19636709 PMCID: PMC2802151","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/U6CZ6Y2F/Lai et al. - 2009 - Glyceryl MonooleatePoloxamer 407 Cubic Nanopartic.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802151/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A recently described ‘salt induced’ method of cubosome production may be suitable for the encapsulation of macromolecular bioactive therapeutics, such as proteins, within the cubic phase. Here, we develop and characterise glycerol-monoolein (GMO)-based cubosomes using this novel method of cubosome production. Using the anionic biological lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine (DPPS) to prevent GMO from forming its natural cubic-phase, we validate that addition of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) can be used to reverse the effects of DPPS. However, this transition is dependent on the type of Pluronic® block copolymer stabiliser used to prevent re-flocculation of the cubosome dispersions. Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, we show that the ‘salt induced’ phase transition, from small unilamellar vesicles to cubosomes, is inhibited when using Pluronic® F127. In contrast, using the larger, more hydrophilic stabiliser Pluronic® F108, cubosomes can be formed, although further analysis using SAXS suggests these GMO-based cubosomes are less thermally stable than those comprising GMO alone. In addition, we find no significant difference in the in vitro cytotoxicity of cubosome dispersions formed using either of these stabilisers, or between those containing DPPS and those without. The ability to control cubic phase transitions may present an opportunity for the incorporation of therapeutically relevant proteins in these nanoparticles.","2015-03-13","2018-08-08 19:38:53","2018-08-08 19:38:53","2018-08-08 19:38:53","26543-26549","","34","5","","RSC Adv.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","pubs.rsc.org","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/4325CL8D/c4ra13890b.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An astonishing variety of synthetic and biological assemblies can be accurately modelled and understood in terms of hyperbolic surfaces, whose richness and beauty are only now being revealed by applied mathematicians, physicists, chemists and crystallographers. These surfaces, often close to periodic minimal surfaces, weave and twist through space, carving out interconnected labyrinths whose range of topologies and symmetries challenge the imaginative powers.The book offers an overview of these structures and structural transformations, convincingly demonstrating their ubiquity in covalent frameworks from zeolites used for cracking oil and pollution control to enzymes and structural proteins, thermotropic and lyotropic bicontinuous mesophases formed by surfactants, detergents and lipids, synthetic block copolymer and protein networks, as well as biological cell assemblies, from muscles to membranes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The relation between structure and function is analysed in terms of the previously neglected hidden variables of curvature and topology. Thus, the catalytic activity of zeolites and enzymes, the superior material properties of interpenetrating networks in microstructured polymer composites, the transport requirements in cells, the transmission of nerve signals and the folding of DNA can be more easily understood in the light of this.The text is liberally sprinkled with figures and colour plates, making it accessible to both the beginning graduate student and researchers in condensed matter physics and chemistry, mineralogists, crystallographers and biologists.","1996-11-19","2018-08-08 20:31:23","2018-08-08 20:31:23","","","397","","","","","The Language of Shape","","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 1LZlSZ7ORrQC","","","https://books.google.com.br/books?id=1LZlSZ7ORrQC","","Mathematics / Geometry / Differential; Science / Chemistry / Physical & Theoretical; Science / Life Sciences / Biochemistry; Science / Physics / Condensed Matter; Technology & Engineering / Materials Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These properties can be used to overcome some of the limitations found in traditional therapeutic and diagnostic agents.","2008-05","2018-08-08 20:54:39","2018-08-08 20:54:39","","761-769","","5","83","","Clin.

The scope of this review covers dispersions of both inverted-type liquid-crystalline particles (cubosomes, hexosomes, micellar cubosomes, and sponge phases), and microemulsion droplets (emulsified microemulsions, EMEs). Recent investigations that have attempted to shed light on the characterization and the control of confined nanostructures of aqueous dispersions are surveyed, as these nanoobjects are attractive for various pharmaceutical and food applications. The focus has been placed on three main subjects: (1) our findings on the formation of EMEs and the modulation of the internal nanostructure, exploring how variations in temperature, oil content, and lipid composition significantly affect the confined nanostructures; (2) recent developments in the field of electron microscopy: using the tilt-angle cryo-TEM method or cryo-field emission scanning electron microscopy (cryo-FESEM) for observing the three dimensional (3D) morphology of non-lamellar liquid-crystalline nanostructured particles (cubosome and hexosome particles); and (3) recent studies on the utilization of nanostructured dispersions as drug nanocarriers.","2009-06","2018-08-08 21:12:27","2018-08-08 21:12:27","","333-342","","","147-148","","Adv Colloid Interface Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 18804754","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18804754","","Drug Delivery Systems; Surface Properties; Water; Particle Size; Drug Carriers; Nanostructures; Emulsions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infectious Diseases","","1474-4457","10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00243-1","","Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected disease, which can lead to cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, megaviscera, and more rarely, polyneuropathy in up to 30-40% of patients around 20 to 30 years after acute infection. Although it is endemic in the Americas, global population movements mean that it can be located wherever migrants from endemic areas settle. The disease was first described 100 years ago and still challenges clinicians worldwide, since diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic methods remain insufficient. Furthermore, factors such as HIV co-infection, immunosuppressive drugs, transplantation, and neoplastic disease can alter the natural course of the infection. We present the case of a Bolivian woman with chronic T cruzi infection diagnosed at our clinic in Madrid, Spain, who subsequently developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Our report illustrates the challenges of an increasingly common infection seen in non-endemic countries, and highlights both daily management dilemmas and associated difficulties that arise.","2015-11","2018-08-09 13:46:31","2018-08-09 13:46:31","","1347-1356","","11","15","","Lancet Infect Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26231478","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231478","","Humans; Chagas Disease; Trypanosoma cruzi; Female; Neglected Diseases; Adult; Antibodies, Protozoan; DNA, Protozoan; Emigrants and Immigrants; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endemic in Latin America where it is the major cause of death from cardiomyopathy, the impact of the disease is reaching global proportions through migrating populations. New drugs that are safe, efficacious, low cost, and adapted to the field are critically needed. Over the past five years, there has been increased interest in the disease and a surge in activities within various organizations. However, recent clinical trials with azoles, specifically posaconazole and the ravuconazole prodrug E1224, were disappointing, with treatment failure in Chagas patients reaching 70% to 90%, as opposed to 6% to 30% failure for benznidazole-treated patients. The lack of translation from in vitro and in vivo models to the clinic observed for the azoles raises several questions. There is a scientific requirement to review and challenge whether we are indeed using the right tools and decision-making processes to progress compounds forward for the treatment of this disease. New developments in the Chagas field, including new technologies and tools now available, will be discussed, and a redesign of the current screening strategy during the discovery process is proposed.","2015-01","2018-08-09 13:47:41","2018-08-09 13:47:41","","22-35","","1","20","","J Biomol Screen","Chagas disease drug discovery","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25245987","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25245987","","Humans; Chagas Disease; Trypanocidal Agents; Trypanosoma cruzi; Clinical Trials as Topic; compound progression criteria; drug discovery; Drug Discovery; Research; secondary assays; translation; Treatment Outcome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Infection was originally transmitted by reduviid insects, congenitally from mother to fetus, and by oral ingestion in sylvatic/rural environments, but blood transfusions, organ transplants, laboratory accidents, and sharing of contaminated syringes also contribute to modern day transmission. Likewise, Chagas disease used to be endemic from Northern Mexico to Argentina, but migrations have earned it global. The parasite has a complex life cycle, infecting different species, and invading a variety of cells - including muscle and nerve cells of the heart and gastrointestinal tract - in the mammalian host. Human infection outcome is a potentially fatal cardiomyopathy, and gastrointestinal tract lesions. In absence of a vaccine, vector control and treatment of patients are the only tools to control the disease. Unfortunately, the only drugs now available for Chagas' disease, Nifurtimox and Benznidazole, are relatively toxic for adult patients, and require prolonged administration. Benznidazole is the first choice for Chagas disease treatment due to its lower side effects than Nifurtimox. However, different strategies are being sought to overcome Benznidazole's toxicity including shorter or intermittent administration schedules-either alone or in combination with other drugs. In addition, a long list of compounds has shown trypanocidal activity, ranging from natural products to specially designed molecules, re-purposing drugs commercialized to treat other maladies, and homeopathy. In the present review, we will briefly summarize the upturns of current treatment of Chagas disease, discuss the increment on research and scientific publications about this topic, and give an overview of the state-of-the-art research aiming to produce an alternative medication to treat T. cruzi infection.","2016-04","2018-08-09 13:48:05","2019-07-05 01:25:11","","1-16","","","156","","Acta Trop.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26747009","","; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747009; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747009; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747009","","Americas; Benznidazol; Chagas disease; Chagas Disease; Humans; Life Cycle Stages; New medication; Nifurtimox; Nitroimidazoles; Trypanocidal Agents; Trypanocidal treatment; Trypanosoma cruzi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, subsequent structure-based chemical optimization and target-based screening require a detailed understanding of the binding event. Here, we use directed evolution and whole-genome sequencing of a drug-sensitive S. cerevisiae strain to identify the yeast ortholog of TcCyp51, lanosterol-14-alpha-demethylase (TcCyp51), as the target of MMV001239, a benzamide compound with activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. We show that parasites treated with MMV0001239 phenocopy parasites treated with another TcCyp51 inhibitor, posaconazole, accumulating both lanosterol and eburicol. Direct drug-protein binding of MMV0001239 was confirmed through spectrophotometric binding assays and X-ray crystallography, revealing a binding site shared with other antitrypanosomal compounds that target Cyp51. These studies provide a new probe chemotype for TcCyp51 inhibition.","2017-02-17","2018-08-09 13:48:37","2018-08-09 13:48:37","","422-434","","2","12","","ACS Chem.

Knowledge of the predictors of prognosis can help clinical decision making by identifying patients' level of risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the published literature on prognostic factors in patients with Chagas disease by performing a PubMed search for articles published in any language between 1985 and February 2006 and hand searches of the reference lists of retrieved articles. Studies were selected if they included patients in the chronic phase of Chagas disease, analyzed a clearly defined outcome (all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac deaths, and/or cardiovascular deaths), and used multivariable regression models of prognosis. From 606 potentially relevant studies, 12 met the inclusion criteria: 8 clinic-based studies including 3928 patients and 4 hospital-based studies including 349 patients. Impaired left ventricular function by echocardiogram or cineventriculogram was found to be the most common and consistent independent predictor of death. New York Heart Association functional class III/IV and cardiomegaly on the chest radiography also were independently associated with higher mortality. More recently, strong evidence was found that nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour Holter monitoring indicated an adverse prognosis. The typical ECG abnormalities showed limited additional prognostic value. Other often-mentioned risk factors, advanced age and male sex, showed inconsistent results. A formal meta-analysis was not feasible because of the heterogeneity of published studies and the lack of minimal standards in reporting results. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of published studies indicates that impaired left ventricular function, New York Heart Association class III/IV, cardiomegaly, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia indicate a poor prognosis in patients with chronic Chagas disease.","2007-03-06","2018-08-09 13:49:29","2018-08-09 13:49:29","","1101-1108","","9","115","","Circulation","Predictors of mortality in chronic Chagas disease","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17339568","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17339568","","Humans; Chagas Disease; Female; Chronic Disease; Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Cardiomegaly; Case Management; Chagas Cardiomyopathy; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Electrocardiography; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Failure; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Latin America; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Radiography; Risk; Tachycardia, Ventricular; Ultrasonography; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additional information was collated during meetings conducted at WHO regional level between 2007 and 2011. Two questionnaires regarding epidemiology and drug access were completed by experts and national program managers. Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence ranges were estimated by country and epidemiological region based on reported incidence, underreporting rates if available, and the judgment of national and international experts. Based on these estimates, approximately 0.2 to 0.4 cases and 0.7 to 1.2 million VL and CL cases, respectively, occur each year. More than 90% of global VL cases occur in six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widely distributed, with about one-third of cases occurring in each of three epidemiological regions, the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, and western Asia from the Middle East to Central Asia. The ten countries with the highest estimated case counts, Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica and Peru, together account for 70 to 75% of global estimated CL incidence. Mortality data were extremely sparse and generally represent hospital-based deaths only. Using an overall case-fatality rate of 10%, we reach a tentative estimate of 20,000 to 40,000 leishmaniasis deaths per year. Although the information is very poor in a number of countries, this is the first in-depth exercise to better estimate the real impact of leishmaniasis. These data should help to define control strategies and reinforce leishmaniasis advocacy.","2012","2018-08-09 15:25:31","2018-08-09 15:25:31","","e35671","","5","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22693548 PMCID: PMC3365071","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22693548","","Humans; Female; Male; Geography; Internationality; Leishmaniasis; Time Factors; World Health Organization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cubosomes are nanoparticles which are self assembled liquid crystalline particles of certain surfactants with proper ratio of water with microstructure that provides unique properties of practical interest. Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline phase is optically clear and very viscous material has the unique structure at nanometer scale. The word bicontinuous refers to the division of the two continuous but non-intersecting aqueous regions by lipid bilayer that is twisted into space filling structure. Hydrating a surfactant or polar lipid that forms cubic phase and then dispersing a solid like phase into smaller particles usually forms a cubosomes. Self-assembled cubosomes as active drug delivery systems are receiving more and more attention and interest after the first discovery and nomination. They exhibit different internal cubic structure and composition with different drug-loading modalities. It has high internal surface area and cubic crystalline structures, relatively simple preparation method, biodegradability of lipids, the ability of encapsulating hydrophobic, hydrophilic and amphiphilic substances, targeting and controlled release of bioactive agents. Cubosomes are having wide range of applications in various fields and they can be characterized by various evaluation parameters. So, Cubosomes are gaining more attention by pharmaceutical development sector.","2013","2018-08-09 15:52:07","2018-08-09 15:56:32","","481-486","","6","2","","Sch Acad J Pharm","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/WRRR7PNC/Bhosale et al. - Cubosomes The Inimitable Nanoparticulate Drug Car.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The process entails simple mixing of two waterlike solutions with a minimal input of energy. The key to this process is the inclusion of hydrotrope. Most lipids, such as monoolein, used to form cubic liquid crystals are essentially insoluble in water. The hydrotrope dissolves the lipid to create a waterlike solution. Water is added to the hydrotrope solution, resulting in a precipitous decrease in lipid solubility. Provided that the dilution trajectory falls into a cubic phase−water miscibility gap, nanometer-scale cubic liquid crystalline particles form spontaneously, presumably from a homogeneous nucleation mechanism. The process is versatile enough to accommodate any lipid and hydrotrope combination that forms cubic liquid crystalline material upon dilution. Actives and stabilizers can be formulated into either of the two solutions, allowing the production of colloidally stabilized, controlled-release dispersions. The phase diagram of the monoolein−ethanol−water system is determined to assess appropriate formulation of solutions and to develop dilution trajectories. This process replaces current processes that require long hold times, processing of solidlike materials, and very high-energy inputs to create cubosome nanoparticle dispersions. This process produces smaller, more stable cubosomes than by conventional bulk dispersion techniques.","2001-09-01","2018-08-09 21:45:32","2019-07-05 01:25:54","2018-08-09 21:45:32","5748-5756","","19","17","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/F5Q62KK7/la010161w.html; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/6L6P9D8J/la010161w.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: The characteristic of the cubosome was studied by using scanning electron microscope (SEM), Infrared spectrum and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. Tissue distribution of cubosome was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method in mice. RESULTS: The characteristic of the cubosome was demonstrated that the curcumin and piperine were encapsulated in the interior of the cubosome and the crystal form was Pn3m space. The pharmacokinetic test revealed that the cubosome could improve the oral bioavailability significantly compared to the suspension of curcumin with piperine and be mainly absorbed by the spleen. CONCLUSION: These findings provide the reference to a preferable choice of the curcumin formulation and contribute to therapeutic application in clinical research.","2014","2018-08-09 22:08:13","2019-07-05 01:26:06","","551-559","","6","31","","J Microencapsul","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24641575","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641575; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641575","","Alkaloids; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Benzodioxoles; Bioavailability; cubosome; curcumin; Curcumin; Mice; Nanocapsules; Particle Size; Piperidines; piperine; Polyunsaturated Alkamides; Scattering, Small Angle; Spleen; Tissue Culture Techniques; X-Ray Diffraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

B, Biointerfaces","","1873-4367","10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.05.091","","The formation of significant proportions of liposomes during the preparation of dispersed cubic phase particles presents a problem in trying to understanding cubosome behavior with a view to use in applications such as drug delivery. In this study, the variables impacting on liposome formation during cubosome production were interrogated. Bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) approaches were employed to prepare submicron sized liquid crystalline dispersions (cubosomes) of phytantriol in water with varying amounts of Pluronic(®)F127 (F127) as a stabilizer. In the BU approach, ethanol was used as a hydrotrope and was later removed using a rotary evaporator, whereas in the TD approach the bulk liquid gel was dispersed using ultrasonication. We aimed at finding the optimum ratio of phytantriol-to-F127 resulting in stable, liposome-free dispersions, whether this depends on the preparation method and the resulting morphology of the particles. The average particle size and zeta potential of the samples were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) images showed a substantial number of liposomes in addition to cubosomes in the dispersion containing 4-1 (w/w) phytantriol-to-F127 prepared by the BU approach compared to very low liposome content with the TD approach. The effects of the amount of F127 in both approaches, amount of ethanol on the BU method and temperature on the TD method were investigated using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The cubosomes displayed cubic double-diamond (Pn3m) internal structure with a lattice parameter of approximately 6nm. In summary using the TD approach, with 4:1 phytantriol:F127 provided stable cubosome dispersion with minimal liposome co-existence.","2016-09-01","2018-08-09 22:15:41","2019-07-05 01:25:39","","845-853","","","145","","Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27315333","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315333; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315333","","Cryo-TEM; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Cubosomes; Fatty Alcohols; Liposomes; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Phytantriol; Pluronic(®)F127; Polyethylenes; Polypropylenes; SAXS; Scattering, Small Angle; X-Ray Diffraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Critical evaluation of cryo-techniques for Transmission Electron Microscopy: preparation of biological samples","Folia Histochemica Et Cytobiologica","","1897-5631","10.5603/FHC.2014.0001","","Over the years Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) has evolved into a powerful technique for the structural analysis of cells and tissues at various levels of resolution. However, optimal sample preservation is required to achieve results consistent with reality. During the last few decades, conventional preparation methods have provided most of the knowledge about the ultrastructure of organelles, cells and tissues. Nevertheless, some artefacts can be introduced at all stagesofstandard electron microscopy preparation technique. Instead, rapid freezing techniques preserve biological specimens as close as possible to the native state. Our review focuses on different cryo-preparation approaches, starting from vitrification methods dependent on sample size. Afterwards, we discuss Cryo-Electron Microscopy Of VItreous Sections (CEMOVIS) and the main difficulties associated with this technique. Cryo-Focused Ion Beam (cryo-FIB) is described as a potential alternative for CEMOVIS. Another post-processing route for vitrified samples is freeze substitution and embedding in resin for structural analysis or immunolocalization analysis. Cryo-sectioning according to Tokuyasu is a technique dedicated to high efficiency immunogold labelling. Finally, we introduce hybrid techniques, which combine advantages of primary techniques originally dedicated to different approaches. Hybrid approaches permit to perform the study of difficult-to-fix samples and antigens or help optimize the sample preparation protocol for the integrated Laser and Electron Microscopy (iLEM) technique.","2014","2018-08-09 22:19:04","2019-07-05 01:24:59","","1-17","","1","52","","Folia Histochem.

METHODS: Standard polystyrene beads of sizes ranging from 60 to 1,000 nm and physical mixtures thereof were analyzed with NTA and DLS. The influence of different ratios of particle populations was tested. Drug delivery nanoparticles and protein aggregates were analyzed by NTA and DLS. Live monitoring of heat-induced protein aggregation was performed with NTA. RESULTS: NTA was shown to accurately analyze the size distribution of monodisperse and polydisperse samples. Sample visualization and individual particle tracking are features that enable a thorough size distribution analysis. The presence of small amounts of large (1,000 nm) particles generally does not compromise the accuracy of NTA measurements, and a broad range of population ratios can easily be detected and accurately sized. NTA proved to be suitable to characterize drug delivery nanoparticles and protein aggregates, complementing DLS. Live monitoring of heat-induced protein aggregation provides information about aggregation kinetics and size of submicron aggregates. CONCLUSION: NTA is a powerful characterization technique that complements DLS and is particularly valuable for analyzing polydisperse nanosized particles and protein aggregates.","2010-05","2018-08-09 22:58:52","2019-07-05 01:25:03","","796-810","","5","27","","Pharm.

Liposomes and microsomes were used as model of a lipid membrane and lipid peroxidation was induced by free radical ascorbyl. Nanocapsule and nanosphere suspensions presented total recoveries of melatonin near 100% and associated drug around 55%. The zeta potential values were negative and the hydrodynamic diameter of particles were lower than 255 nm. The results demonstrate that the lipids were protected against peroxidation from 8 to 51% due to the presence of the melatonin and that this effect depended on the drug dose, the type of the lipid substrate and the type of colloid, in which melatonin was incorporated. Nanocapsules and nanospheres provided an important increase in the antioxidant effect of melatonin against lipid peroxidation.","2005-01-31","2018-08-09 23:05:13","2018-08-09 23:05:13","","209-213","","1-2","289","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 15652213","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652213","","Humans; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Dosage Forms; Lipid Peroxidation; Melatonin; Protective Agents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With special emphasis being given here to duplicating in vivo conditions, it was possible to demonstrate an excellent qualitative agreement between the two methods.  In all cases, the absorption pattern determined in vitro rather precisely paralleled the pattern which was obtained in vivo.  Quantitative agreement between the two sets of data was less than perfect, although the in vitro method adequately distinguished compounds of low permeability from those of high permeability and ranked then in approximately the same order found in vivo.

Both these independent maxima were investigated in modified membranes in order to elucidate the participation of the main types of membrane proteins. The modification protocols included the bilateral proteolytic digestion of membranes with 2-20 micrograms/ml trypsin, denaturation of the peripheral protein spectrin by exposing the membranes to 50 degrees C for 4 min or 1.5 M urea for 20 h, and preparation of the inside-out vesicles depleted of main peripheral proteins. Only the second maximum was registered in these membranes. Also, both maxima were absent in the unilamellar liposomes prepared from lipids extracted from intact membranes. The results indicate that different types of proteins were involved in the two disturbances: peripheral proteins (mainly spectrin)--in the first one and part of integral proteins-in the second. The different sensitivities of the disturbances to local anesthetics, protein thermostabilizers, n-alcohols, and detergents correlated with this conclusion. A correlation between the peak temperature of the second disturbance and the sphingomyelin content in the membrane of mammalian erythrocytes was also shown.","1997","2018-09-20 16:52:47","2019-07-05 01:25:48","","45-56","","1","11","","Membr Cell Biol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9257281","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9257281; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9257281","","Alcohols; Anesthetics, Local; Blood Proteins; Cell Membrane Permeability; Detergents; Erythrocyte Membrane; Hot Temperature; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Oleic Acid; Spectrin; Sphingomyelins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This capture is mediated by a β-galactolectin present in the membrane of macrophages. The evidence supporting these conclusions is as follows:(1) Analysis by flow cytofluorimetry of the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled lectins specific for sialic acids shows that the aged erythrocytes bind less WGA, LPA, SNA and MAA than young erythrocytes. The binding of DSA and LCA is not modified. On the contrary, the number of binding sites of UEA-I specific for O antigen and of AAA decreases significantly. PNA and GNA do not bind to erythrocytes. (2) RCA120 as well asErythrina cristagalli andErythrina corallodendron lectins specific for terminal β-galactose residues lead to unexpected and unexplained results with a decrease in the number of lectin binding sites associated with increasing desialylation. (3) The glycoconjugates from the old erythrocytes incorporate more sialic acid than the young cells. This observation results from the determination of the rate of transfer by α-2,6-sialyltransferase of fluorescent or radioactiveN-acetylneuraminic acid, using as donors CMP-9-fluoresceinyl-NeuAc and CMP-[14C]-NeuAc, respectively. (4) Microscopy shows that the old erythrocytes are captured preferentially by the macrophages relative to the young ones. Fixation of erythrocytes by the macrophage membrane is inhibited by lactose, thus demonstrating the involvement of a terminal β-galactose specific macrophage lectin. (5) Comparative study of the binding of WGA, LPA, SNA and MAA to the aged erythrocytes and to thein vitro enzymatically desialylated erythrocytes shows that the desialylation rate of aged cells is low but sufficient to lead to their capture by the macrophages","1995-06-01","2018-10-02 17:34:37","2019-07-05 01:25:28","2018-10-02 17:34:37","258-267","","3","12","","Glycoconjugate J","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","endogeneous galactolectin; erythrophagocytosis; flow cytofluorimetry; lectins; macrophages; Senescent erythrocytes; sialic acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These membrane proteins are band 3 and glycophorins A–D, and some substoichiometric glycoproteins (e.g., CD44, CD47, Lu, Kell, Duffy). The oligosaccharide that band 3 contains has one N-linked oligosaccharide, and glycophorins possess mostly O-linked oligosaccharides. The end of the O-linked oligosaccharide is linked to sialic acid. In humans, this sialic acid is N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc). Another sialic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) is present in red blood cells of non-human origin. While the biological function of band 3 is well known as an anion exchanger, it has been suggested that the oligosaccharide of band 3 does not affect the anion transport function. Although band 3 has been studied in detail, the physiological functions of glycophorins remain unclear. This review mainly describes the sialo-oligosaccharide structures of band 3 and glycophorins, followed by a discussion of the physiological functions that have been reported in the literature to date.

For a drug to be delivered passively via the skin it needs to have adequate lipophilicity and also a molecular weight <500 Da. These requirements have limited the number of commercially available products based on transdermal or dermal delivery. Various strategies have emerged over recent years to optimize delivery and these can be categorized into passive and active methods. The passive approach entails the optimization of formulation or drug carrying vehicle to increase skin permeability. Passive methods, however do not greatly improve the permeation of drugs with molecular weights >500 Da. In contrast active methods that normally involve physical or mechanical methods of enhancing delivery have been shown to be generally superior. Improved delivery has been shown for drugs of differing lipophilicity and molecular weight including proteins, peptides, and oligonucletides using electrical methods (iontophoresis, electroporation), mechanical (abrasion, ablation, perforation), and other energy-related techniques such as ultrasound and needless injection. However, for these novel delivery methods to succeed and compete with those already on the market, the prime issues that require consideration include device design and safety, efficacy, ease of handling, and cost-effectiveness. This article provides a detailed review of the next generation of active delivery technologies.","2006-06","2019-02-12 15:58:41","2019-07-05 01:25:14","","175-187","","3","13","","Drug Deliv","Dermal and transdermal drug delivery systems","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16556569","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/QD6GRMEJ/Brown et al. - 2006 - Dermal and transdermal drug delivery systems curr.pdf; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/CTY5R54E/Brown et al. - 2006 - Dermal and transdermal drug delivery systems curr.pdf; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16556569; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16556569","","Administration, Cutaneous; Dermabrasion; Drug Delivery Systems; Electroporation; Forecasting; Humans; Injections, Jet; Iontophoresis; Needles; Phonophoresis; Punctures; Skin Absorption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various colloids have a different ability to do this by penetrating narrow pores of fixed size in the skin, or the relevant nano-pores in barriers modelling the skin. Such ability is governed by colloid adaptability, which must be high enough to allow penetrant deformation to the size of a pore in such barrier: for a 100 nm colloid trespassing the skin this means at least 5-fold deformation/elongation. (Lipid) Bilayer vesicles are normally more adaptable than the comparably large (lipid coated) fluid droplets. One of the reasons for this, and an essential condition for achieving a high bilayer adaptability and pore penetration, is a high bilayer membrane elasticity. The other reason is the relaxation of changing colloid's volume-to-surface constraint during pore penetration; it stands to reason that such relaxation requires a concurrent, but only transient and local, bilayer permeabilisation. Both these phenomena are reflected in bilayer composition sensitivity, which implies non-linear pressure dependency of the apparent barrier penetrability, for example. Amphipats that acceptably weaken a membrane (surfactants, (co)solvents, such as certain alcohols, etc.) consequently facilitate controlled, local bilayer destabilisation and increase lipid bilayer flexibility. When used in the right quantity, such additives thus lower the energetic expense for elastic bilayer deformation, associated with pore penetration. Another prerequisite for aggregate transport through the skin is the colloid-induced opening of the originally very narrow (∼0.4 nm) gaps between cells in the barrier to pores with diameter above 30 nm. Colloids incapable of enforcing such widening—and simultaneously of self-adapting to the size of 20–30 nm without destruction—are confined to the skin surface. All relatively compact colloids seem to fall in this latter category. This includes mixed lipid micelles, solid (nano)particles, nano-droplets, biphasic vesicles, etc. Such colloids, therefore, merely enter the skin through the rare wide gaps between groups of skin cells near the organ surface. Transdermal drug delivery systems based on corresponding drug formulations, therefore, rely on simple drug diffusion through the skin; the colloid then, at best, can modulate drug transport through the barrier. In contrast, the adaptability-and stability-optimised mixed lipid vesicles (Transfersomes®, a trademark of IDEA AG) can trespass much narrower pathways between most cells in the skin; such highly adaptable colloids thus mediate drug transport through the skin. Sufficiently stable ultra-adaptable carriers, therefore, can ensure targeted drug delivery deep below the application site. This has already been shown in numerous preclinical tests and several phase I and phase II clinical studies. Drug delivery by means of highly adaptable drug carriers, moreover, allows highly efficient and well-tolerated drug targeting into the skin proper. Sustained drug release through the skin into systemic blood circulation is another field of ultradeformable drug carrier application.","2004-03-27","2019-02-12 16:13:04","2019-02-12 16:13:04","2019-02-12 16:13:04","675-711","","5","56","","Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","","Breaking the Skin Barrier","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/AF2RPXX4/Cevc - 2004 - Lipid vesicles and other colloids as drug carriers.pdf; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/RW44S4KP/S0169409X03002448.html","","","Emulsions; Epicutaneous phase behaviour; Pore density; Pores; Transcutaneous hydrophilic pathways; Transferosomes; Ultradeformable vesicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short-term effect of four different liposome formulations and two references during 3.5 h was investigated non-occlusively on the volar side of the forearm of 10 volunteers, ranging in age from 24 to 32 years. Liposomes composed of different phospholipids showed differing effects on skin humidity. The maximal effect was achieved within 30 min and constant values were reached after 1.5 h for all formulations, however values remained significantly higher than without treatment (p<0.05) during the whole application time. The best results were obtained with liposome formulations prepared from egg phospholipids, which exhibited a 1.5-fold increase in skin water content (p<0.05), whereas liposome formulations prepared from soya phospholipids showed no advantage compared to the references. Skin barrier function showed greatest influence within 30 min after application and remained constant after 1.5 h for all formulations. Within the liposome formulations, egg phospholipids showed the highest transepidermal water loss values during the first 30 min, representing the strongest interactions with the skin barrier function, whereas for the other liposome formulations lower transepidermal water loss values were measured. Skin elasticity and tiring effect of the skin was not influenced by any of the formulations, due to the young skin tested.

First hints that follicular penetration needs to be taken into consideration were confirmed by recent investigations, presented during the workshop ""Follicular Penetration and Targeting"" at the 4th Intercontinental Meeting of Hair Research Societies"", in Berlin 2004. Hair follicles represent an efficient reservoir for the penetration of topically applied substances with subsequent targeting of distinct cell populations, e.g., nestin-expressing follicular bulge cells. The volume of this reservoir can be determined by differential stripping technology. The follicular penetration processes are significantly influenced by the state of the follicular infundibulum; recent experimental investigations could demonstrate that it is essential to distinguish between open and closed hair follicles. Topically applied substances can only penetrate into open hair follicle. Knowledge of follicular penetration is of high clinical relevance for functional targeting of distinct follicular regions. Human hair follicles show a hair-cycle-dependent variation of the dense neuronal and vascular network. Moreover, during hair follicle cycling with initiation of anagen, newly formed vessels occur. Thus, the potential of nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells to form neurons and blood vessels was investigated.","2005-12","2019-02-12 22:02:16","2019-02-12 22:02:16","","301-303","","3","10","","J.

Loan; Gooris, Gert S.; Ponec, Maria","Structure of the skin barrier and its modulation by vesicular formulations","Progress in Lipid Research","","0163-7827","","","The natural function of the skin is to protect the body from unwanted influences from the environment. The main barrier of the skin is located in the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum. Since the lipids regions in the stratum corneum form the only continuous structure, substances applied onto the skin always have to pass these regions. For this reason the organization in the lipid domains is considered to be very important for the skin barrier function. Due to the exceptional stratum corneum lipid composition, with long chain ceramides, free fatty acids and cholesterol as main lipid classes, the lipid phase behavior is different from that of other biological membranes. In stratum corneum crystalline phases are predominantly present, but most probably a subpopulation of lipids forms a liquid phase. Both the crystalline nature and the presence of a 13 nm lamellar phase are considered to be crucial for the skin barrier function. Since it is impossible to selectively extract individual lipid classes from the stratum corneum, the lipid organization has been studied in vitro using isolated lipid mixtures. These studies revealed that mixtures prepared with isolated stratum corneum lipids mimic to a high extent stratum corneum lipid phase behavior. This indicates that proteins do not play an important role in the stratum corneum lipid phase behavior. Furthermore, it was noticed that mixtures prepared only with ceramides and cholesterol already form the 13 nm lamellar phase. In the presence of free fatty acids the lattice density of the structure increases. In stratum corneum the ceramide fraction consists of various ceramide subclasses and the formation of the 13 nm lamellar phase is also affected by the ceramide composition. Particularly the presence of ceramide 1 is crucial. Based on these findings a molecular model has recently been proposed for the organization of the 13 nm lamellar phase, referred to as ""the sandwich model"", in which crystalline and liquid domains coexist. The major problem for topical drug delivery is the low diffusion rate of drugs across the stratum corneum. Therefore, several methods have been assessed to increase the permeation rate of drugs temporarily and locally. One of the approaches is the application of drugs in formulations containing vesicles. In order to unravel the mechanisms involved in increasing the drug transport across the skin, information on the effect of vesicles on drug permeation rate, the permeation pathway and perturbations of the skin ultrastructure is of importance. In the second part of this paper the possible interactions between vesicles and skin are described, focusing on differences between the effects of gel-state vesicles, liquid-state vesicles and elastic vesicles.","2003-01","2019-02-12 22:14:13","2019-02-12 22:14:13","","1-36","","1","42","","Prog.

S.; Singh, M.","Structure-activity relationship of chemical penetration enhancers in transdermal drug delivery","Current Medicinal Chemistry","","0929-8673","","","Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) is the administration of therapeutic agents through intact skin for systemic effect. TDD offers several advantages over the conventional dosage forms such as tablets, capsules and injections. Currently there are about eight drugs marketed as transdermal patches. Examples of such products include nitroglycerin (angina pectoris), clonidine (hypertension), scopolamine (motion sickness), nicotine (smoking cessation), fentanil (pain) and estradiol (estrogen deficiency). Since skin is an excellent barrier for drug transport, only potent drugs with appropriate physicochemical properties (low molecular weight, adequate solubility in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, etc) are suitable candidates for transdermal delivery. Penetration enhancement technology is a challenging development that would increase significantly the number of drugs available for transdermal administration. The permeation of drugs through skin can be enhanced by physical methods such as iontophoresis (application of low level electric current) and phonophoresis (use of ultra sound energy) and by chemical penetration enhancers (CPE). In this review, we have discussed about the CPE which have been investigated for TDD. CPE are compounds that enhance the permeation of drugs across the skin. The CPE increase skin permeability by reversibly altering the physicochemical nature of the stratum corneum, the outer most layer of skin, to reduce its diffusional resistance. These compounds increase skin permeability also by increasing the partition coefficient of the drug into the skin and by increasing the thermodynamic activity of the drug in the vehicle. This review compiles the various CPE used for the enhancement of TDD, the mechanism of action of different chemical enhancers and the structure-activity relationship of selected and extensively studied enhancers such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols and terpenes. Based on the chemical structure of penetration enhancers (such as chain length, polarity, level of unsaturation and presence of some special groups such as ketones), the interaction between the stratum corneum and penetration enhancers may vary which will result in significant differences in penetration enhancement. Our review also discusses the various factors to be considered in the selection of an appropriate penetration enhancer for the development of transdermal delivery systems.","2000-06","2019-02-12 22:16:09","2019-02-12 22:16:09","","593-608","","6","7","","Curr.

Most of these are small and compact proteins. A model for how crystals form by the in meso method has been proposed that invokes a transition between mesophases. In light of this model, we speculated that a more hydrated and open mesophase, of reduced interfacial curvature, would support facile crystallization of bigger and bulkier proteins. The proposal was explored here by performing crystallization in the presence of additives that swell the cubic phase. The additive concentration inducing swelling, as quantified by small-angle X-ray diffraction, coincided with a “crystallization window” in which two, very different transmembranal proteins produced crystals. That the swollen mesophase can grow structure-grade crystals was proven with one of these, the light-harvesting II complex. In most regards, the structural details of the corresponding complex resembled those of crystals grown by the conventional vapour diffusion method, with some important differences. In particular, packing density in the in meso-grown crystals was dramatically higher, more akin to that seen with water-soluble proteins, which accounts for their enhanced diffracting power. The layered and close in-plane packing observed has been rationalized in a model for nucleation and crystal growth by the in meso method that involves swollen mesophases. These results present a rational case for including mesophase-swelling additives in screens for in meso crystallogenesis. Their use will contribute to broadening the range of membrane proteins that yield to structure determination.","2006-04-14","2019-05-27 18:22:12","2019-05-27 18:22:12","2019-05-27 18:20:58","1605-1618","","5","357","","Journal of Molecular Biology","Room to Move","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/9YGBVMF6/Cherezov et al. - 2006 - Room to Move Crystallizing Membrane Proteins in S.pdf; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/I4SNZGJR/S0022283606000787.html","","","cubic phase; light harvesting complex II; sponge phase; vitamin B12 transporter; X-ray crystallography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To make intelligent use of the monoolein/water system, a reliable and detailed temperature–composition phase diagram is needed. The phase diagram of Briggs et al.

By implementing a sub-zero degree (°C) sample incubation prior to data collection in the heating direction, we can reset the system into the lamellar crystal phase which we assume represents equilibrium behavior. We have re-examined the low-temperature part of the phase diagram and characterized structurally the new `equilibrium’ phases by static and time-resolved low- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction and by differential scanning calorimetry.

In this work, we test the hypothesis that long lived bulk nanobubbles are produced upon mixing ethanol and water, using techniques that probe the density and the pressure response of the nanoparticles. Experiments Nanoparticles were generated spontaneously upon mixing high-purity ethanol and high-purity water. The size distribution of these nanoparticles was obtained using nanoparticle tracking analysis. The mean density of the nanoparticles was determined using resonant mass measurement, and the response of the nanoparticles to the application of external pressure was measured using dynamic light scattering. Findings The ethanol-water mixture was found to produce only positively buoyant particles, with a mean density of 0.91 ± 0.01 g/cm3, and the external pressure had only a minimal effect on the size of these nanoparticles. Degassing the solvents before mixing led to a significant reduction in the number of nanoparticles produced. Allowing the solutions to re-gas restored their ability to produce nanoparticles.

Cubosomes are colloidal carriers composed of biodegradable Glyceryl monooleate and F127. Being composed of well tolerable and physiological materials, these carriers are well tolerated, compatible and non-toxic. In this study, therefore, we developed a novel, water-soluble, glyceryl monooleate and F127 based multiblock copolymer for Gambogenic acid (GNA) by emulsion-evaporation and low temperature-solidification technique. Physicochemical properties, in vitro cytotoxicity, cellular uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetic of GNA-loaded cubosomes (GNA-Cubs) were investigated. The results revealed that GNA-Cubs were spherical or ellipsoidal monocellular by dynamic light scattering, meanwhile, 150-250nm in mean size with narrow polydispersity indexas determined by transmission electron microscopy. Small angle X-ray scattering indicated that GNA-Cubs retain the Pn3m cubic symmetry. Compared with GNA solution, GNA-Cubs exhibited markedly prolonged inhibitory activity in SMMC-7721 cells, as well as time-dependent increases in intra-cellular uptake. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacokinetic study showed that the Cmax values and the AUC of GNA-Cubs were higher than GNA solution approximately 1.2-fold and 9.1-fold, respectively.

Previously cubosomes have been characterized by cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryo TEM) with small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXS) confirming the bicontinuous liquid crystalline type. Bulk cubic phase and cubosomes were prepared from phytantriol and Pluronic F127 and analysed using cryo FESEM and SAXS. The micrographs showed the cubic phase had a tortuous, bicontinuous nature with a non-intersecting network of water channels. The cubosomes also show the same underlying tortuous structure entirely consistent with that of the bulk cubic phase and closely resemble the mathematical description of cubosomes described using nodal surface representation. The structure of both systems was confirmed using SAXS as a bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline phase with Pn3m geometry. Cryo FESEM provides valuable insights into the morphological features of bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline systems. The unique details shown provide strength to support the nodal surface representation of bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline systems.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of poloxamer (P407) gel as a vehicle for the novel lipid base particulate system (cubosome dispersions) of ALA. Cubosome dispersions were formulated by two different approaches, emulsification of glyceryl monoolein (GMO) and poloxamer (P407) in water followed by ultrasonication, and the dilution method using a hydrotrope. Three different concentrations of GMO were used to formulate the cubosome dispersions using the first method, 5% (D1), 10% (D2) and 15% w/w (D3). In the second technique an isotropic liquid was produced by combining GMO with ethanol, and this isotropic liquid was then diluted with a P407 solution (D4). The dispersions were characterized by zeta potential, light scattering techniques, optical and transmission electron microscopy, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release. Results showed that D4 was not a uniform dispersion and that D1, D2 and D3 were uniform dispersions, in which by increasing the GMO content in the dispersion, the size of the cubosomes decreased, zeta potential became more negative, encapsulation efficiency increased up to 86.48% and the drug release rate was slower. P407 gels were prepared using the cold method. Two concentrations of P407 gel were fabricated, 20 and 30% w/w. P407 gels were loaded with either ALA or dispersions containing ALA cubosomes. P407 gels were characterized by critical gelation temperature, rheological measurements and in vitro drug release studies. Results suggested that by increasing P407 concentration, the gelation temperature decreases and viscosity increases. Drug release in both cases was found to follow the Higuchi square root model. Gel loaded with ALA cubosomes provided a significantly lower release rate than the gel loaded with the un-encapsulated ALA. A double blinded placebo controlled clinical study was conducted, aiming to evaluate the efficacy as an anti-wrinkle agent and volunteer's satisfaction upon application of topical 30% P407 gel loaded with ALA cubosomes. Results indicated reduction in facial lines, almost complete resolution of fine lines in the periorbital region and upper lip area and overall improvement in skin color and texture in most volunteers. There were no instances of irritation, peeling or other apparent adverse side effects.","2014-02","2019-06-07 13:27:19","2019-07-05 01:26:17","","251-259","","2","86","","Eur J Pharm Biopharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24056055","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24056055; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24056055","","Adult; Alpha lipoic acid; Antioxidant; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Clinical study; Cosmeceutical application; Cubosomes; Double-Blind Method; Drug release; Female; Gels; Glyceryl monooleate; Humans; Liquid crystals; Middle Aged; Nanostructures; Particle Size; Pharmaceutical Vehicles; Poloxamer; Poloxamer gel; Rheology; Skin Aging; Temperature; Thioctic Acid","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

About 80% of ORI was released in vitro from GMO- and PYT-based cubosomes at 24 h, showing a sustained release kinetics fitted with Higuchi's equation. The pharmacokinetic study in rats showed that the PYT-based cubosomes significantly enhanced the adsorption of ORI as compared to the GMO-based cubosomes and ORI suspension, with evidence of longer half-life and greater relative bioavailability (p < 0.01).

Despite the interest, cubosomes can be difficult to fabricate and stabilize with current methods. Most of the current work is limited to liquid phase processes involving high shear dispersion of bulk cubic liquid crystalline material into sub-micron particles, limiting application flexibility. In this work, two types of dry powder cubosome precursors are produced by spray-drying: (1) starch-encapsulated monoolein is produced by spray-drying a dispersion of cubic liquid crystalline particles in an aqueous starch solution and (2) dextran-encapsulated monoolein is produced by spray-drying an emulsion formed by the ethanol–dextran–monoolein–water system. The encapsulants are used to decrease powder cohesion during drying and to act as a soluble colloidal stabilizer upon hydration of the powders. Both powders are shown to form (on average) 0.6 μm colloidally-stable cubosomes upon addition to water. However, the starch powders have a broader particle size distribution than the dextran powders because of the relative ease of spraying emulsions versus dispersions. The developed processes enable the production of nanostructured cubosomes by end-users rather than just specialized researchers and allow tailoring of the surface state of the cubosomes for broader application.","2002-08-01","2019-06-07 13:28:33","2019-06-07 13:28:33","2019-06-07 13:28:33","297-311","","4","4","","Journal of Nanoparticle Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/SQ969ZJB/Spicer et al. - 2002 - Dry Powder Precursors of Cubic Liquid Crystalline .pdf","","","controlled-release; liquid crystal; monoolein; nanoparticles; polymer; powder; spray drying","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The discovery of cubosomes is a unique story and spans the field of food science, differential geometry, biological membranes and digestive processes. One of the most common surfactants used to make cubosomes is the monoglyceride glycerol monoolein. Bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline phase is an optically clear, very viscous material that has a unique structure at the nanometer scale. The word bicontinuous refers to the division of the two continuous but non-intersecting aqueous regions by a lipid bilayer that is contorted into a space-filling structure. Hydrating a surfactant or polar lipid that forms cubic phase and then dispersing the solid-like phase into smaller particles usually form Cubosomes.

In vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to investigate the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of different delivery systems containing antioxidant molecules. For instance, ethosomes, organogels, monoolein aqueous dispersions and solid lipid nanoparticle have been considered. It was found that micro and nanoencapsulation strategy can improve the solubility of lipophilic molecules and the chemical stability of labile antioxidants, thus prolonging their efficacy. In vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted that antioxidant encapsulation prolongs release kinetics, bioavailability and antioxidant effects. Noticeably, some encapsulated antioxidants effectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation, cell migration and colony formation, thus suppressing cancer progression.","2019-02-28","2019-06-11 14:07:01","2019-06-11 14:07:01","","","","","","","Mini Rev Med Chem","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30836911","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836911","","monoolein; nanoparticles; antioxidant; chemical stability; microparticles; phospholipids.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Structure analysis and biological implications","Journal of Molecular Biology","","0022-2836","","","Of the six cubic phases identified so far in lipid-containing systems, the structures of only two have been determined unambiguously. We tackle the structure determination of the other four. We use for that purpose a novel pattern recognition approach, which consists of generating all the sets of phase angles (phi-sets) compatible with the observed reflections, and of screening them in a search for the ""best"" one. Two criteria are used for screening: both involve the parameter [(delta rho)4] (delta rho is a dimensionless function proportional to the Fourier transform of the set of observed structure factors). One is a test of smoothness, based upon the postulate that the ""best"" phi-set is that whose [(delta rho)4] is minimum; this criterion, equivalent to maximum entropy, is fulfilled when the system is devoid of heavy atoms, and when the polar and the hydrocarbon moieties occupy almost equal volumes. The other criterion is based upon the notion that [(delta rho)4] takes the same (or similar) values in thermodynamic phases with the same (or similar) chemical composition, whatever the structure of the phases. The validity of the two criteria is verified using numerous examples. The six cubic phases are analysed using this approach. The structure of three of them (Q230, Q224, Q229) can be described in terms of two three-dimensional networks of connected rods, mutually intertwined and unconnected: in Q230 the rods are coplanarly joined 3 by 3; in Q224 the rods are tetrahedrally joined 4 by 4; in Q229 the rods are cubically joined 6 by 6. The structures of Q212 and Q227 are related to those of Q230 and Q224, respectively; one of the two networks of rods is preserved, the other is replaced by a lattice of closed micelles. The structure of Q223 appears to consist of a cage-like continuous three-dimensional network of connected globules, coplanarly joined 3 by 3 at one end and 4 by 4 at the other, enclosing a three-dimensional lattice of closed micelles. The analogies of the structures of Q230, Q224, Q229 with the three fundamental cubic infinite periodic minimal surfaces are discussed. More interestingly, the structures of, on the one hand Q230, Q224, Q229 and of Q212, Q227, Q223 on the other, are shown to provide topological generalizations of the two paradigms of lipid organization; namely, the bilayer and the monolayer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1988-11-05","2019-06-11 14:12:23","2019-06-11 14:12:23","","165-189","","1","204","","J.

For this reason, miRNAs have been proposed and investigated as biomarkers and therapeutics for various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, delivery of miRNAs and their antagomirs to target sites remains challenging because of poor cellular uptake and degradation by nucleases. Various delivery systems have been investigated for enhanced delivery of miRNAs to cells, organs, and tissues of interest, thereby enabling evaluation of their biological functions and clinical trials. In particular, non-viral, polymer-based carriers have shown advantages such as versatility of structural modifications and protection of unstable miRNA. Herein, we review properties and applications of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid), chitosan, polyethyleneimine, and polyamidoamine dendrimers as carriers for effective delivery systems of miRNA mimic or anti-miRNAs that directly target essential miRNAs and/or their target genes. A number of miRNAs in clinical trials appear to use chemically modified miRNAs without any particular delivery system except one study with liposomal miRNA. With more accumulation of positive research results on polymeric delivery of miRNA in vitro and in vivo, we expect that polymeric delivery system will accelerate advancement of miRNA therapeutics to clinical study in the near future.","2019-05-02","2019-06-18 14:40:43","2019-06-18 14:40:43","","","","","","","Drug Deliv Transl Res","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31049843","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049843","","Anti-miRNAs; Formulation; MicroRNA delivery; miRNA mimic; Polymer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the most important applications of viruses is phage display, which has already been employed to identify a broad range of potential therapeutic peptides and antibodies, as well as other biotechnologically relevant polypeptides (including protease inhibitors, minimizing proteins, and cell/organ targeting peptides). Additionally, their high stability, easily modifiable surface, and enormous diversity in shape and size, distinguish viruses from synthetic nanocarriers used for drug delivery. Indeed, several plant and bacterial viruses (e.g., phages) have been investigated and applied as drug carriers. The ability to remove the genetic material within the capsids of some plant viruses and phages produces empty viral-like particles that are replication-deficient and can be loaded with therapeutic agents. This review summarizes the current applications of plant viruses and phages in drug discovery and as drug delivery systems and includes a discussion of the present status of virus-based materials in clinical research, alongside the observed challenges and opportunities.","2019-05-03","2019-06-18 14:39:58","2019-06-18 14:39:58","","","","5","11","","Pharmaceutics","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31058814","","; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/ENYW8BJZ/Sokullu et al. - 2019 - PlantBacterial Virus-Based Drug Discovery, Drug D.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058814","","drug discovery; bacteriophage; drug delivery; encapsulation; phage display; plant; virus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LNFs with solid matrices may be typically categorized into three major types of formulations, viz., solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and lipid-drug conjugate nanoparticles (LDC-NPs). Solid matrix based LNFs are, potentially, the most appropriate delivery systems for poorly water soluble drugs in need of improved drug solubility, permeability, absorption, or increased oral BA. In addition, LNFs as matrices are able to encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs in a single matrix based on their excellent ability to form cores and shells. Interestingly, LNFs also act as delivery devices to impart chemical stability to various orally administered drugs. Areas covered: Aim of the review is to forecast the presentation of pharmacokinetic characteristics of solid lipid matrix based nanocarriers which are typically biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic carrier systems for efficient oral delivery of various drugs. Efficient delivery is broadly mediated by the fact that lipophilic drugs are readily soluble in lipidic substrates that are capable of permeating across the gut epithelium following oral administration, subsequently delivering the moiety of interest more efficiently across the gut mucosal membrane. This enhances the overall BA of many drugs facing oral delivery challenges by improving their pharmacokinetic profile. This article specifically focuses on the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic aspects of such solid lipid matrix based nanoformulations and possible mechanisms for better drug absorption and improved BA following oral administration. It also briefly reviews methods to access the efficacy of LNFs for improving oral BA of drugs, regulatory aspects and some interesting lipid-derived commercial formulations, with a concluding remark. Expert opinion: LNFs enhance the overall BA of many drugs facing oral delivery challenges by improving their pharmacokinetic profile.","2019-06","2019-06-18 14:37:58","2019-06-18 14:37:58","","499-515","","6","15","","Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31104522","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31104522","","Humans; Drug Delivery Systems; Animals; Solubility; Permeability; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Drug Carriers; Nanoparticles; Lipids; Administration, Oral; Biological Availability; Drug Stability; absorption; improved bioavailability; Lipid nanoparticle formulations; oral delivery; pharmacokinetic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various nanostructures, like liposomes, dendrimers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, etc. have been designed for the said purpose. These nanostructures have several advantages over traditional administration of medicine. Apart from overcoming the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics limitations of many potential therapeutic molecules, they may also be useful for advanced drug delivery purposes like targeted drug delivery, controlled release, enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.

In order to provide tumor-targeting and diagnostic properties, PLGA or PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) can be modified with other functional materials. Hydrophobic or hydrophilic therapeutic cargos can be placed in the internal space or adsorbed onto the surface of PLGA NPs. Protocols for the fabrication of PLGA-based NPs for cancer imaging and therapy are already well established. Moreover, the biocompatibility and biodegradability of PLGA may elevate its feasibility for clinical application in injection formulations. Size-controlled NP's properties and ligand-receptor interactions may provide passive and active tumor-targeting abilities, respectively, after intravenous administration. Additionally, the introduction of several imaging modalities to PLGA-based NPs can enable drug delivery guided by in vivo imaging.

Exosomes contain proteins, mRNAs, non-coding RNAs (miRNAs and lncRNAs) and lipids that are derived from producing cells. These nano-sized vesicles are present in biofluids including blood, urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, semen and conditioned media of cultured cells. Methods: This review summarizes current progress on the strategies of development of diagnostic biomarkers and drug loading onto exosomes for overcoming cancer progression. Results: A number of studies indicate that the exosome appears to be a key player in tissue repair and regeneration of in a number of animal disease models. In addition, alterations of the molecular profiles in exosomes are known to be correlated with the disease progression including cancer, suggesting their usefulness in disease diagnosis and prognosis. Studies utilizing engineered exosomes either by chemical or biological methods have demonstrated promising results in a number of animal models with cancer. Conclusion: Understanding the molecular and cellular properties of exosomes offer benefits for cancer diagnosis by liquid biopsy and for their application in therapeutic drug delivery systems. Studies have shown that genetic or molecular engineering of exosomes augmented their target specificity and anticancer activity with less toxicity.

Because functionalised CNT display low toxicity and are not immunogenic, such systems hold great potential in the field of nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine.","2005-12-01","2019-06-18 13:06:07","2019-06-18 13:06:07","2019-06-18 13:06:07","674-679","","6","9","","Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","","Biopolymers / Model systems","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/4AH6QPPL/S1367593105001389.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nanomedicine and Nanobiotechnology","","1939-0041","10.1002/wnan.1417","","Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM or cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) offer robust and powerful ways to visualize nanoparticles. These techniques involve imaging of the sample in a frozen-hydrated state, allowing visualization of nanoparticles essentially as they exist in solution. Cryo-TEM grid preparation can be performed with the sample in aqueous solvents or in various organic and ionic solvents. Two-dimensional (2D) cryo-TEM provides a direct way to visualize the polydispersity within a nanoparticle preparation. Fourier transforms of cryo-TEM images can confirm the structural periodicity within a sample. While measurement of specimen parameters can be performed with 2D TEM images, determination of a three-dimensional (3D) structure often facilitates more spatially accurate quantization. 3D structures can be determined in one of two ways. If the nanoparticle has a homogeneous structure, then 2D projection images of different particles can be averaged using a computational process referred to as single particle reconstruction. Alternatively, if the nanoparticle has a heterogeneous structure, then a structure can be generated by cryo-ET. This involves collecting a tilt-series of 2D projection images for a defined region of the grid, which can be used to generate a 3D tomogram. Occasionally it is advantageous to calculate both a single particle reconstruction, to reveal the regular portions of a nanoparticle structure, and a cryo-electron tomogram, to reveal the irregular features. A sampling of 2D cryo-TEM images and 3D structures are presented for protein based, DNA based, lipid based, and polymer based nanoparticles.

However, technical aspects of sample preparation are overlooked and erroneous image interpretations are regularly encountered in the literature. There are three most commonly used TEM methods as we derived from literature: drying, staining and cryo-TEM, which are explained here with respect to their application, limitations and interpretation. Since soft matter chemistry relies on a lot of indirect evidence, the role of TEM for the correct evaluation of the nature of an assembly is very large. Mistakes in application and interpretation can therefore have enormous impact on the quality of present and future studies. We provide helpful background information of these three techniques, the information that can and cannot be derived from them and provide assistance in selecting the right technique for soft matter imaging. This essay warns against the use of drying and explains why. In general cryo-TEM is by far the best suited method and many mistakes and over-interpretations can be avoided by the use of this technique.","2017","2019-06-17 19:43:31","2019-06-17 19:43:31","","1600476","","5","4","","Adv Sci (Weinh)","Transmission Electron Microscopy as a Tool for the Characterization of Soft Materials","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28546914 PMCID: PMC5441488","","; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/CSX2G5X4/Franken et al. - 2017 - Transmission Electron Microscopy as a Tool for the.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28546914","","artefacts; cryo‐TEM; sample preparation; self‐assembly; vesicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aims to improve CB intestinal solubility and absorption through developing a novel stable dry CB procubosomes tablets ready to disintegrate and re-disperse upon dilution in the GIT forming in situ CB cubosome nanoparticles while simultaneously overcome the poor stability of conventional cubosome dispersion at room temperature. Glyceryl monooleate based CB cubosome dispersion was prepared using Poloxamer 407 as surfactant, freeze dried using different stabilizing excipients (dextrose, mannitol and avicel) then compressed into procubosome tablets.

However, the drug delivery mechanism and cubosome interaction with human cells and bacteria are still poorly understood. Herein, we reveal how cubosomes loaded with the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37, a system with high bacteria-killing effect, interact with the bacterial membrane and provide new insights into the eradication mechanism. Combining the advanced experimental techniques neutron reflectivity and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, a mechanistic drug delivery model for LL-37-loaded cubosomes on bacterial mimicking bilayers was constructed. Moreover, the cubosome interaction with Escherichia coli was directly visualized using super-resolution laser scanning microscopy and cryogenic electron tomography.

Emulsion droplets containing water, ethanol, and the lipid glyceryl monooleate are suspended in a yield stress fluid and used to produce shapes based on cubic and hexagonal symmetry by slow crystallization. The underlying liquid crystalline ordering of the aqueous lipid system drives symmetric shape formation, while its amphiphilicity allows incorporation of various organic monomers. Photopolymerization of monomers in the lipid templates creates polymeric particles shaped like polyhedra based on cubic symmetry as well as biconical cylinders based on hexagonal symmetry, and their shape is preserved after template removal. Product particle shapes are controlled by varying the structures and hydrophobicity of the monomers, as they control formation of different phases and microstructures. Monomer polarity determines whether the template can exhibit hexagonal phase, as when divinylbenzene is used, or cubic phase, when di(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate is used. The monomers also control the microstructure of the final particles produced, forming rigid shapes composed of linked polymer nanospheres when divinylbenzene or di(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate are used, and soft hydrogel particles when N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide is used.","2019-06-15","2019-06-19 21:21:08","2019-07-05 01:25:58","","240-250","","","546","","J Colloid Interface Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30925432","","; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/TBFTWJCA/Wang et al. - 2019 - Polymerization of cubosome and hexosome templates .pdf; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/C9UVJJ4F/S0021979719303674.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925432","","Cubosome; Hexosome; Photopolymerization; Polymerization; Shape; Template","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An emulsion capable of forming cubosomes with the protein ovalbumin as model antigen was used as vaccine formulation and spray dried. The produced powders had low residual moisture content, independent of the spray drying parameters within the range investigated. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy revealed that cubosomes were produced after rehydration regardless of the spray drying parameters. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering showed that the average diameter of the rehydrated particles consistently was close to 230 nm at any combination of spray drying parameters as long as the outlet temperature was kept below a threshold of 115 °C. The process thus appears to be robust allowing optimization to be focused on yield, dry particle engineering or outlet temperature considerations.","2019-02","2019-06-19 21:43:48","2019-06-19 21:43:48","","44-48","","","135","","Eur J Pharm Biopharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30576708","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576708","","Temperature; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Nanoparticles; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Colloids; Monoolein; Peptides; Vaccines; Design of experiments; Dynamic Light Scattering; Ovalbumin; Particles; Powders; Technology, Pharmaceutical; Vaccine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Clonazepam (Cl) was formulated as cubosomal-gel (cub-gel) to be used as a patch reservoir through transdermal-route. Cubosomes prepared using glycerol-mono-oleate(GMO)/Pluronic-F127(PF127) mixture. An actual-statistical design was used to investigate the effect of different stabilizing agents (Ethanol and PVA) and surfactant concentration on cubosomes' particle size and entrapping-efficiency. The selected formulae were evaluated by testing particle-morphology, in vitro drug release and stability. Cub-gel was prepared using selected cubosome formulae. The optimal cub-gel subjected to in vitro dissolution, ex-vivo permeation and skin deposition studies followed by studying its pharmacological effect. Results: Using PVA or Et as stabilizers with PF127 significantly decreases the average cubosomes'PS (352 ±  2.8 and 264 ± 2.16 nm) and increases EE (58.97 ± 4.57% and 54.21 ± 3.89%). Cubosomes increase the initial release rate of Cl to ensure rapid therapeutic effect (37.39% and 46.04% in the first hour) followed by a prolonged release till 4 h. Cub-gel containing PVA showed significantly higher Cl-transdermal permeation when compared to Cl-suspension. Moreover, increases the retention-time (89.57% at 48 h) and skin-deposition up to 6-times. It also reduces the epileptic seizures and alters the behavioral parameters induced by pilocarpine. Conclusions: Cubosomal-gel could be considered an innovative dosage-form for Cl through the transdermal route.","2018-09","2019-06-19 22:02:03","2019-06-19 22:02:03","","790-800","","6","26","","Saudi Pharm J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30202219 PMCID: PMC6128721","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/6W97EM4W/El-Enin and Al-Shanbari - 2018 - Nanostructured liquid crystalline formulation as a.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202219","","Cubosomes; Antiepileptic; Cl, Clonazepam; Clonazepam; CNS, Central Nervous System; Cubogels; Cubs, cubosomes; EE, entrapping efficiency; Epilepsy; Et, ethanol; GMO, glycerol-mono-oleate; I.P, Intraperitoneal injections; PBS, phosphate buffer saline; PCS, peripheral cholinergic signs; PDI, polydispersity index; PF127, Poloxamer 407; PS, particle size; PVA, polyvinyl alcohol; SMS, stereotyped movements signs; TDDS, Transdermal Drug Delivery System","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system, which is composed by monolinolein and linoleic acid (97:3 wt % ratio) in the presence of excess water at 37 °C and 150 mM ionic strength, is specifically designed to reversibly change from a Im3m reverse bicontinuous cubic phase to a HII reverse columnar hexagonal phase, when changing the pH from neutral (pH 7) to acidic (pH 2) conditions, to simulate intestine and stomach conditions, respectively. The pH responsiveness is provided by the linoleic acid, which, being a weak acid (pKa ≈ 5), is essentially in the deprotonated charged state at pH 7 and mainly protonated and neutral at pH 2, imposing changes in the critical packing parameter (CPP) of the lyotropic liquid crystal. The use of this system as an efficient controlled-release delivery vehicle is demonstrated on the model hydrophilic drug phloroglucinol, by both release and diffusion studies at different pH, as followed by ultraviolet−visible (UV−vis) spectroscopy. The Im3m cubic phase at pH 7 is shown to release 4 times faster than the HII phase at pH 2, making this system an ideal candidate for oral administration of drugs for targeted delivery in intestine or colon tracts.","2011-05-03","2019-06-27 19:48:12","2019-06-27 19:48:12","2019-06-27 19:48:12","5296-5303","","9","27","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","","","/Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/SA88WHJF/la200591u.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current in vivo pH measurement techniques are invasive and/or provide poor spatial resolution. Therefore, there are no data on perivascular interstitial pH gradients in normal or tumor tissue. We have optically measured interstitial pH gradients with high resolution in normal and tumor (VX2 carcinoma) tissue in vivo by combining a fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy technique and the rabbit ear chamber preparation. The strengths of our approach include the ability to follow pH in the same location for several weeks and to relate these measurements to local blood flow and vascular architecture. Our results show: (a) tumor interstitial pH (6.75 units; N = 6 animals, n = 324 measurements) is significantly (P < 0.001) less than normal interstitial pH (7.23; N = 5, n = 274). This increased acidity in the tumor interstitium is in agreement with the previously reported data on this tumor; (b) with respect to pH spatial gradients in normal tissue, the interstitial pH decreased by approximately 0.32 pH units over a distance of 50 microns away from the blood vessel, while in tumor tissue, interstitial pH decreased by approximately 0.13 units over the same distance. Although the pH gradient near the vessel wall was steeper in normal tissue compared to tumor, the proton concentration gradient in normal tissue was less than that in the tumor. The approximate increase in proton concentration from 0-50 microns from the vessel was 4.5 x 10(-8)M in normal versus 5.7 x 10(-8)M in tumor tissue; (c) a simple one-dimensional diffusion-reaction model suggested that tumor tissue was producing protons at a rat 65-100% greater than normal tissue; (d) feasibility studies of temporal dynamics resulting from hyperglycemia (6 g/kg) or hypercapnia (10% CO2) led to significant (P < 0.05) interstitial pH reductions. During hyperglycemia, pH dropped by more than 0.2 pH units in about 90 min in tumor tissue but remained constant in normal tissue. Hypercapnia dramatically reduced pH by approximately 0.3 pH units in tumor tissue. Our limited studies on hyperglycemia and hypercapnia are in agreement with the previously published studies and demonstrate the capability of fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy to measure spatial as well as temporal changes in interstitial pH. Fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy should permit noninvasive evaluation of new pH-modifying agents and offer unique mechanistic information about tumor pathophysiology in tissue preparations where the surface of the tissue can be observed.","1994-11-01","2019-06-27 19:59:36","2019-06-27 19:59:36","","5670-5674","","21","54","","Cancer Res.","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 7923215","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7923215","","Animals; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Rabbits; Male; Diffusion Chambers, Culture; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypercapnia; Hyperglycemia; Neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pH-dependent drug release profiles, evaluated by voltammetry, demonstrated triggered drug release from the cubosome carrier to the environment of the cancer cells, where pH is lower.

METHODS: Nano-cubosomes bearing either cisplatin alone or cisplatin-metformin combination were formulated using emulsification technique. The loaded nano-cubosomes were characterized in vitro and the optimized formulation was selected. Their cytotoxic effects were investigated by Sulphorhodamine-B (SRB) assay. The AMPK/mTOR metabolic pathway as well as the Akt/mTOR pathway were analyzed using ELISA technique. Colorimetry was used in NADPH oxidase, LDH and caspase-3 activity determination. RESULTS: nano-cubosomal formulations exhibited superior cytotoxic effect compared to unformulated cisplatin. This cytotoxic effect was profound upon incorporation of metformin, an indirect mTOR inhibitor, in cisplatin nano-cubosomes. The induced CRC cell apoptosis was through inhibition of several metabolic pathways, namely, AMPK/mTOR and Akt/mTOR. Drug-loaded nano-cubosomes ensued depletion in glucose and energy levels that led to AMPK activation and thus mTOR inhibition. mTOR was additionally inhibited via suppression of p-Akt (Ser473) levels after nano-cubosomal treatment. Moreover, drug-loaded nano-cubosomes produced a notable escalation in ROS levels, evident as an increase in NADPH oxidase, inhibition of LDH and a consequential upsurge in caspase-3. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated the influence exerted by cisplatin-loaded nano-cubosomes on CRC cell survival and enhancement of their cytotoxicity upon metformin addition.","2018-08-15","2019-07-03 02:08:56","2019-07-03 02:08:56","","822","","1","18","","BMC Cancer","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30111296 PMCID: PMC6094476","","; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/HHBXGJK9/Saber et al. - 2018 - Targeting colorectal cancer cell metabolism throug.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111296","","Apoptosis; Humans; Animals; Mice; Cell Survival; Nanostructures; AMPK; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Autophagy; Caspase 3; Cisplatin; Colorectal Neoplasms; Drug Synergism; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HCT116 Cells; Metformin; mTOR; Nano-cubosomes; Protein Kinases; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cubosomal nanoparticles were prepared by disrupting the cubic gel phase of the polysaccharide and water in the presence of a surfactant. Different lipid matrices and stabilizers were tested. All the formulations were in the nanosize range and showed sufficient negative charge to inhibit the aggregation of the cubosomes. Drug entrapment efficiencies (EEs%) were determined and in vitro release studies were performed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry were used to analyze the loaded cubosomal nanoparticles containing glyceryl monostearate (GMO 2.25 g), poloxamer 407 (0.25 g) and 50 mg of the polysaccharide. A preclinical study comparing the cubic liquid crystalline nanoparticles containing polysaccharide to fluvastatin as a reference drug in hyperlipidaemic rats was conducted. The rats treated with the polysaccharide- loaded cubosomes showed significant decreases in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and total lipid (TL) compared to the untreated HL rats. In addition, oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers were measured in the HL rats. Compared to the untreated HL rats, the cubosome treated rats showed a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA), whereas insignificant changes were detected in nitric oxide (NO), glutathione (GSH) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Further, vascular and intercellular adhesion molecules (VCAM, ICAM), and myeloperoxidase were demonstrated. A histopathological examination was conducted to study the alterations in histopathological lesions and to document the biochemical results. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the superiority of using a natural lipid regulator such as polysaccharide loaded cubosomes instead of fluvastatin.","2018-02","2019-07-03 01:54:21","2019-07-03 01:54:21","","224-231","","2","26","","Saudi Pharm J","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30166920 PMCID: PMC6111190","","; /Users/brunacasadei/Zotero/storage/GJPFFNWN/Matloub et al. - 2018 - Cubic liquid crystalline nanoparticles containing .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30166920","","Cubosomes; Antihyperlipidaemic; Cubic liquid crystalline nanoparticle; Polysaccharide; Ulva fasciata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SIGNIFICANCE: Colloidal aqueous dispersions of lyotropic liquid crystal mesophases such as the identified as cubosomes and hexosomes, and so on, have received considerable attention due to their unique nanostructures and their thermodynamic properties, which provide the potential as a sustained drug release matrix. Additionally, their large surface area and similarity with the liquid crystal structures of intercellular lipids of stratum corneum enhances the interaction with the skin and mucous, increasing the potential for topical drug delivery efficiency of biopharmaceutical class II drugs as the antifungal ketoconazole. METHODS: This article presents the results in morphological characteristics, particle size, ζ potential, flow, thermal behavior and drug release studies of hexosomes containing ketoconazole (LHLC-K) obtained with glycerol monooleate, propylene glycol monolaurate, poloxamer, and water mixtures. RESULTS: This colloidal system exhibits a Newtonian-type flow and a hexagonal nanostructure with a median particle size of 107 ± 20 nm and ζ potential of +4.45 ± 0.50 mV. Through differential scanning calorimetry studies, the LHLC-K demonstrated physical and chemical stability for more than six months and mesophasic thermal reversibility between 10 and 50 °C.

Yet, its efficacy is limited by its poor solubility in intestinal pH, its main site of absorption. The main aim of this study is to enhance the intestinal release of CB by loading in cubosome nanoparticles. Glyceryl monooleate (GMO) based CB loaded cubosomes were prepared using a 33 factorial design to study the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poloxamer 407 (PL407) concentrations and ratio of CB to the disperse phase on the average particle size, entrapment efficiency (%EE), in vitro release at 15 min (%Q15), and their morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The release of the optimized formula was compared in buffer transition media (pH 1.2 for 2 h then pH 6.8 for 6 h) to free drug to study the effect of the changing pH in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) on CB release. The antihaemostatic properties of the optimized formula were compared to the commercial product Plavix® using bleeding time (BT) model in rabbits. The prepared cubosomes were in the nano range (115±6.47 to 248±4.63 nm) with high %EE (91.22±4.09% to 98.98±3.21%). The optimized formula showed significantly higher (p<0.05) CB release in intestinal pH and preserved the high% released (95.66±1.87%) in buffer transition release study compared to free drug (66.82±4.12%) as well as significantly (p<0.05) higher antihaemostatic properties with longer BT (628.47±6.12 s) compared to Plavix® (412.43±7.97 s).

The liquid crystalline internal structure of phytantriol-based cubosomes can be changed to alter the interfacial contact area/topology with the aqueous dispersant to trigger bioactive payload release or to alter the local membrane curvature around bound or embedded proteins. To enable the study of payload distribution, structure and transformation kinetics within phytantriol particles by neutron scattering techniques it is desirable to have access to a deuterated version of this molecule but to date a synthetic route has not been available. The first successful synthesis of phytantriol-d39 is presented here alongside a preliminary physical characterisation of related particle structures when phytantriol-d39 is dispersed using two non-ionic surfactants, Tween® 80 and Pluronic® F127. Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to confirm that phytantriol-d39-based nanoparticles in D2O form similar liquid crystalline structures to those of their natural isotopic abundance (phytantriol/H2O) counterparts as a function of temperature. Finally, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with solvent contrast to match out the phytantriol-d39 structuring was used to show that the spatial correlations between the Tween® and Pluronic® non-ionic surfactant molecules are different within dispersed phytantriol-d39 particles with different liquid crystalline structures in D2O. The surfactant molecules in phytantriol-d39/Tween® 80 particles with Im3m cubic structures were found to follow a self-avoiding walk, whereas in phytantriol-d39/Pluronic® F127 particles with Pn3m cubic structures they were found to follow a more rod-like packing arrangement.","2019-01-15","2019-07-03 01:17:58","2019-07-03 01:17:58","","399-407","","","534","","J Colloid Interface Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30245337","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30245337","","Phytantriol; Cubosome; Contrast matching; Deuterated; Small angle neutron scattering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current ocular drug delivery in treating glaucoma is confronting a variety of challenges, such as low corneal permeability and bioavailability due to the unique anatomical structure of the human eye. To tackle these challenges, a cubosome drug delivery system for glaucoma treatment was constructed for timolol maleate (TM) in this study. The TM cubosomes (liquid crystalline nanoparticles) were prepared using glycerol monooleate and poloxamer 407 via high-pressure homogenization. These constructed nanoparticles appeared spherical using transmission electron microscopy and had an average particle size of 142 nm, zeta potential of -6.27 mV, and over 85% encapsulation efficiency. Moreover, using polarized light microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), it was shown that the TM cubosomes have cubic liquid crystalline D-type (Pn3m) structure, which provides good physicochemical stability and high encapsulation efficiency. Ex vivo corneal permeability experiments showed that the total amount of TM cubosomes penetrated was higher than the commercially available eye drops. In addition, in vivo studies revealed that TM cubosomes reduced the IOP in rabbits from 27.8∼39.7 to 21.4∼32.6 mmHg after 1-week administration and had a longer retention time and better lower-IOP effect than the commercial TM eye drops. Furthermore, neither cytotoxicity nor histological impairment in the rabbit corneas was observed. This study suggests that cubosomes are capable of increasing the corneal permeability and bioavailability of TM and have great potential for ocular disease treatment.","2017-11","2019-07-04 21:07:03","2019-07-04 21:07:03","","2919-2926","","8","18","","AAPS PharmSciTech","Ocular Cubosome Drug Delivery System for Timolol Maleate","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28429294","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429294","","Humans; Drug Delivery Systems; Animals; Rabbits; Particle Size; Female; cubosome; ocular drug delivery; Scattering, Small Angle; X-Ray Diffraction; Administration, Ophthalmic; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Cornea; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; glaucoma; Intraocular Pressure; Ophthalmic Solutions; Timolol; timolol maleate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that the use of a common cubosome formulation consisting of phytantriol (PHYT) as the matrix amphiphile (PHYT-cubosome) led to a 6-fold increase in the solubility of SN38. However, mean hydrodynamic diameter (DH) and polydispersity index (PDI) of these PHYT-cubosome particles were 345±49nm and 0.37±0.05, respectively, making them unsuitable for intravenous applications. Several additives were investigated to increase the solubility of SN38 and reduce the DH and PDI values of the resulting particles. Charged additives such as didodecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) led to improvements in the physiochemical properties of the cubosomes. Notably, the PHYT-DDAB and PHT-SDS cubosomes led to 15- and 14-fold increases in the aqueous solubility of SN38, respectively. Moreover, the SN38 loaded into the PHYT-DDAB and PHYT-SDS cubosomes was found to be highly stable, with very little hydrolysis to its inactive acid form. In summary, the addition of DDAB and SDS to PHYT-cubosome nanoparticle drug delivery systems not only led to considerable improvements in their physiochemical properties, but also enhanced the aqueous solubility of SN38 and increased its chemical stability.","2016-12-30","2019-07-04 21:17:01","2019-07-04 21:17:01","","501-505","","1-2","515","","Int J Pharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27793711","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27793711","","Drug Delivery Systems; Surface-Active Agents; Water; Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; Solubility; Particle Size; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Antineoplastic Agents; Liquid Crystals; Nanoparticles; Cubosomes; Drug Stability; Bromides; Camptothecin; Chemical stability; Hydrolysis; Irinotecan; Poorly water-soluble drug; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; SN38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite these similarities, phytantriol has received little attention in the scientific community. In this study, the thermal phase behavior of the binary PHYT-water and ternary PHYT-vitamin E acetate (VitEA)-water systems have been studied and compared with the behavior of the dispersed cubosomes and hexosomes formed with the aid of a stabilizer (Pluronic F127). The phase behavior and nanostructure were studied using crossed polarized light microscopy (CPLM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. The presence of lipophilic VitEA in the PHYT-water system suppressed the temperature of the Q(II)-to-H(II)-to-L2 transitions, indicating that lipophilic compounds, in relatively small amounts, may have a significant impact on the phase behavior. Increasing the F127 concentration in the phytantriol-based cubosome system did not induce the Q(II)(Pn3m) to Q(II)(Im3m) transition known for the GMO-water system. This indicates a different mode of interaction between F127 and the lipid domains of phytantriol-water systems. Taken together, these results indicate that phytantriol may not only provide an alternative lipid for preparation of liquid crystalline systems in excess water but may also provide access to properties not available when using GMO.","2006-11-07","2019-07-04 21:31:01","2019-07-04 21:31:01","","9512-9518","","23","22","","Langmuir","Bulk and dispersed aqueous phase behavior of phytantriol","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17073473","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17073473","","alpha-Tocopherol; Temperature; Polymers; Molecular Structure; Glycerides; Nanostructures; Phase Transition; Fatty Alcohols; Liquid Crystals; Polyethylenes; Polypropylenes; Tocopherols","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to investigate whether Tween 80 could be used to stabilise phytantriol-based cubosomes thereby enabling potential application in delivering macromolecular therapeutics to the brain. Cubosome particles with their large internal and external surface area by virtue of their nanostructure are ideal for delivery of macromolecules. Phase behaviour studies were conducted using a combination of optical microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and the addition of Tween 80 to mixtures of phytantriol and water resulted in a rich array of lyotropic mesophases. In particular, a large cubic phase region and a two-phase region of readily dispersed cubosomes is observed. Cubosomes with different concentrations of Tween 80 and phytantriol as the liquid crystal forming lipid were prepared using the solvent precursor method and their physical properties were investigated. A combination of dynamic light scattering, cryogenic electron tomography and SAXS shows formation of well-defined cubosomes with a narrow size distribution and the Im3m cubic structure. Collectively, the results confirm that Tween 80 can effectively stabilize phytantriol cubosomes, opening the possibility for future application in drug delivery across the BBB. Moreover, well-defined, homogenous cubosome formulations prepared using the mild solvent precursor dilution method has significant implications for large-scale production of cubosomes, which currently is a major barrier to the application of cubosomes in the clinic.","2016-07","2019-07-05 01:03:54","2019-07-05 01:03:54","","148-155","","","104","","Eur J Pharm Biopharm","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27163239","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27163239","","Drug Carriers; Nanoparticles; Lipids; Cubosomes; Phytantriol; Blood-Brain Barrier; Blood–brain barrier; Cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET); Pluronic F127; Polysorbates; Tween 80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, its efficacy is limited by its poor solubility in intestinal pH, its main site of absorption. The main aim of this study is to enhance the intestinal release of CB by loading in cubosome nanoparticles. Glyceryl monooleate (GMO) based CB loaded cubosomes were prepared using a 33 factorial design to study the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poloxamer 407 (PL407) concentrations and ratio of CB to the disperse phase on the average particle size, entrapment efficiency (%EE), in vitro release at 15 min (%Q15), and their morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The release of the optimized formula was compared in buffer transition media (pH 1.2 for 2 h then pH 6.8 for 6 h) to free drug to study the effect of the changing pH in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) on CB release. The antihaemostatic properties of the optimized formula were compared to the commercial product Plavix® using bleeding time (BT) model in rabbits. The prepared cubosomes were in the nano range (115±6.47 to 248±4.63 nm) with high %EE (91.22±4.09% to 98.98±3.21%). The optimized formula showed significantly higher (p<0.05) CB release in intestinal pH and preserved the high% released (95.66±1.87%) in buffer transition release study compared to free drug (66.82±4.12%) as well as significantly (p<0.05) higher antihaemostatic properties with longer BT (628.47±6.12 s) compared to Plavix® (412.43±7.97 s). Thus, cubosomes proved to be a successful platform to enhance the intestinal release of CB and improve its absorption.","2018-12-01","2019-07-18 16:51:18","2019-07-18 16:51:18","","1165-1173","","12","66","","Chem.
